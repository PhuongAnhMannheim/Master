But the point is you\'re here.\\" And now that Molly is in \\"the room where it happens,\\" how will she stay in the room?\\u00A0 Comedians often talk about \\"tough crowds,\\" audiences who are begrudging with their laughter. Well, comedians are the toughest crowd of all. \\"Late Night,\\" directed by Nisha Ganatra (whose television credits are lengthy, including Kaling\'s The Mindy Project) is a feel-good movie - in the best sense - with subversive commentary woven into it, so subtly at times you might miss some of it. \\"Late Night\\" has a lot to say, not just about \\"diversity\\" as represented by Kaling walking into a writer\'s room of all white males, but also diversity in terms of class, gender, and age. Kaling was first hired as a writer on NBC\'s \\"The Office\\" through a diversity initiative, after getting a lot of attention for \\"Matt & Ben,\\" the off-Broadway play she co-wrote with Brenda Withers, where Kaling played - hilariously - Ben Affleck. \\"Late Night\\" comes directly from Kaling\'s own experiences. This is an earnest and funny comedy, with very sharp teeth.\\u00A0\\n\\n  Advertisement\\n  \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n            googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\'div-gpt-ad-block-atf-inline\'); });\\n          \\n        \\n  \\n\\n\\n Late-night TV is, notoriously, male-dominated, but in \\"Late Night\\" Kaling imagines a world where the King of Late Night is actually a Queen. (This choice has real satirical bite.) Newbury has been hosting Tonight for 30 years. Her office is lined with her Emmy Awards. She has refused to compromise her standards (as she sees it), and has rejected social media, memes, viral videos, etc. She\'s British, so accusations of her being an \\"elitist\\" don\'t bother her in the slightest. But her ratings going into a nosedive ... that does bother her. Katherine\'s writing staff is made up of men. She has never gotten to know them, and many of them have never even met her. The president of the network (Amy Ryan) wants to replace Katherine with a Dane-Cook-type (Ike Barinholtz), whose \\"provocative\\" routines might give the show some juice. In a panic, Katherine - known for not liking women - orders her right-hand man Brad (Denis O\\u2019Hare) to hire a woman, stat. It\'s the most brazen \\"tokenism\\" you can imagine. Molly Patel just happens to be interviewing with Brad on that very same day. She has no experience, but you can see Brad considering the optics, ticking off the boxes: she\'s a woman, and she\'s a woman of color. She\'s hired.\\u00A0 When Molly walks into that writer\'s room, nobody wants her there. There isn\'t even a chair for her, and she has to sit on an overturned trash can. Reid Scott plays Tom, who keeps reminding everyone that he writes Katherine\'s monologues. Tom is a \\"legacy hire,\\" and yet he feels superior to Molly\'s status as a \\"diversity hire.\\" In his mind, it\'s different. The only guy who is somewhat open to Molly is Charlie (Hugh Dancy), but turns out he\'s a Ladies Man, he\'s got conquest on his mind. Kaling has made some interesting choices in how she has positioned Molly. Molly is not out there working comedy clubs, performing with improv groups, engaged in the hustle. Before getting the writing job, Molly worked Quality Control in a \\"chemical plant\\" (she corrects people who call it a \\"factory\\"), entertaining the workers on the floor with an ongoing \\"comedy routine\\" over the loudspeaker. She is truly an outsider. This gives Kaling a lot of room, since Molly is naive enough to be starry-eyed about the opportunity she\'s been given. She doesn\'t know any better. She shows up for her first day of work bearing cupcakes. One of her mantras is Yeats\' Cloths of Heaven, which she chants as she walks towards the office:\\u00A0 But I, being poor, have only my dreams;I have spread my dreams under your feet;Tread softly because you tread on my dreams. Molly brings her Quality Control experience to bear, suggesting ways to make the show better (ingratiating herself with no one). Kaling knows this territory very well, the lack of diversity in writers\' rooms, plus the overall boys\' club mentality of comedy in general. The pioneering Joan Rivers talked and wrote about it for years. (Rivers remembered being onstage at Second City in the middle of a group improv, and when she stepped into a scene in progress, all the guys held out their arms at her, like, \\"Stay back. We don\'t want you in this scene.\\") Despite the toxicity of much of this, Kaling\'s approach is light-hearted, and she\'s got a great sense of the absurd. There are no villains. Even the guys who clearly don\'t want her there are just beneficiaries of a system set up long before they came around. Amy Ryan\'s character at first seems like a witch on high heels, but she\'s not', 'i>wrong</i', 'about Katherine being out of touch and arrogant. Something has got to change.\\u00A0  \\n    Advertisement\\n    \\n          \\n          \\n            \\n              googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\\"div-gpt-ad-block-btf-inline\\"); });\\n            \\n          \\n    \\n  \\n\\n This is some of Emma Thompson\'s best work (and that\'s saying something). There\'s a truly subversive sequence where Newbury gets embroiled in her own #MeToo moment, calling into question many assumptions about men, women, and power. What\'s subversive about it is how it shows the complexities behind the scenes, the pain, the human frailty, but how does one even address these complexities in such a savage \\"off with her head\\" atmosphere? Kaling addresses it. It\'s very bold. Katherine\'s husband (John Lithgow) is kindly and indulgent, and suffering from a debilitating disease. There\'s always more going on than meets the eye. As Molly gets sucked into the rhythms of her job, it gives Kaling an opportunity to critique how things work, but also - in some of the smartest sequences - examine why jokes work, what makes a joke go viral, the subtleties of comedy itself.\\u00A0 On one level, \\"Late Night\\" has no surprises. Everything happens as you would expect, and right on schedule. But on a deeper satirical level, the level where the movie really works, it\'s one surprise after another. Watch how Molly\'s \\"romance\\" with Charlie is handled. A more conventional movie would have prioritized it in a much different way, giving it more weight than it deserves. Charlie is beautifully in proportion. The movie is not about him. Watch how the dynamic between Molly and Tom develops. It happens almost via stealth, and so the payoff - when it comes - is much more satisfying than it might be otherwise. And mostly, the relationship between Molly and Katherine, growing in fits and starts in scene after scene with Kaling and Thompson - shows two women, struggling to find a handhold in a culture that doesn\'t want them, struggling - at first separately, and then together, to stay \\"in the room where it happens.\\" At Indie Memphis last year, Senior Programmer (and now Artistic Director) Miriam Bale made a speech where she spoke about why the festival was so unique, what made it so special. Bale said, memorably, \\u201CWhen there\\u2019s enough diversity, you don\\u2019t have to worry about diversity. You can focus on art!\\u201D In its own way, \\"Late Night\\" shows how that process can occur. It\'s not easy. You may have to sit on a couple of overturned trash cans in the process. But everybody benefits when more voices are heard.\\n\\n"@en', 'https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/late-night-2019')

The newly christened Snoop Lion appeared on HBO\'s \\"Real Time With Bill Maher\\" a few weeks ago, and throughout his segment, Maher kept smelling his guest. You can bet your last money that Snoop didn\'t smell like April Fresh Downy.Somewhere between inhales, Maher told Snoop \\"you smoke too much weed in this movie!\\"  Snoop agreed, and boy, he was not kidding. If the MPAA were remotely creative, their rating description for \\"Reincarnated\\" would be \\"Rated R for rampant reefer, pervasive pot, some shizznit and constant kutchie passing.\\" This is the first movie that would benefit from being released in Smell-O-Vision.\\u00A0\\n\\n  Advertisement\\n  \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n            googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\'div-gpt-ad-block-atf-inline\'); });\\n          \\n        \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\"Reincarnated\\" has a built-in audience, most of whom will watch it while partaking in Snoop\'s favorite lung filler. They will find much to enjoy here, 80 percent of which will be due to the fact they\'re high as hell. But if you\'re a sober fan of Snoop Dogg\'s rap songs, as I am, you\'re in trouble. \\"Reincarnated\\" comes not to praise Snoop Doggy Dogg but to bury him, documenting Calvin Broadus\' tossing of the Snoop Dogg moniker and the rap career that came with it.After deciding he wants to make a reggae album full of positive messages, Snoop travels to Kingston, Jamaica, to immerse himself in Rastafarian culture. While exploring places like Trench Town, where Bob Marley and his cohorts grew up, Snoop talks about his early years in Long Beach, Calif., and how his environment produced \\"Murder Was The Case,\\" while Marley\'s beget \\"Concrete Jungle.\\" The goal of Snoop Lion is to offset Snoop Dogg\'s \\"negative rap\\" with \\"positive reggae.\\"\\u00A0In an early scene, Snoop meets with reggae legend Bunny Wailer, one of the original members of Bob Marley\'s group. Wailer smokes with Snoop and rechristens him \\"Snoop Lion.\\" The lion is a powerful, respected symbol, and the dog is not. This is a compliment of the highest order, so it becomes a permanent moniker. Snoop asks Wailer to sing on his album, and when Wailer does, his excellent singing contrasts strongly with Snoop\'s attempts.It\'s not that Snoop is a terrible singer; there\'s a great moment in the film where he does a nicely sung impromptu jam with some awestruck kid musicians laying down a wicked, live reggae groove. It\'s just the snippets of the vocals he presents are overprocessed with Auto-Tune and other aggravating holdover devices from rap. Wailer\'s vocal is free of these tricks, and more powerful for it.\\u00A0To create the \\"Reincarnated\\" album, Snoop hires producer Diplo and songwriter Angela Hunte. He meets reggae singer Cutty Corn on the block where Peter Tosh used to live, and when Corn sings him an original composition, Snoop asks if he can record the song with him. Corn brings the \\"struggle part\\" to the \\"Reincarnated\\" album\'s mission statement of \\"songs of peace, love and the struggle.\\"  Snoop also records with his own daughter, who sings a catchy hook that he wrote for her. (Thankfully, she\'s not T-Pained into oblivion by the producers.) Songs like \\"No Guns Allowed\\" deliver Snoop Lion\'s new message, and while \\"Reincarnated\\" includes recording session scenes, we\'re deprived of full versions of any of the songs.\\u00A0  \\n    Advertisement\\n    \\n          \\n          \\n            \\n              googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\\"div-gpt-ad-block-btf-inline\\"); });\\n            </script>\\n          </div>\\n    </div>\\n ', '/article>\\n\\n<p><span style=\\"line-height: 1.45em;\\">As expected from his rap output, Snoop is a good storyteller with a spoken voice I never tire of hearing. To compare and contrast the Snoop Lion persona, he talks about his previous life as \\"Snoop Dogg.\\" This life included robbery, gangs, gunfire, murder trials and the funeral of friend and singer of numerous rap hooks, Nate Dogg. Nate Dogg died of a stroke way too early at 41, and as a fan, I was moved by Snoop\'s account of their friendship and collaboration. Snoop also speaks of his upbringing and his time at Death Row Records. Death Row\'s founder, Suge Knight, gets mentioned doing something nobody else had ever done in the L.A. area, and no, it\'s not an act of violence.\\u00A0</span></p><p><span style=\\"line-height: 1.45em;\\">\\"Reincarnated\\" shines when it focuses on comparisons between the birthplaces of the two sides of Calvin Broadus. The kids who play instruments for Snoop Lion are from a school for troubled boys run by Sister Shirley Chung. As rewards for good behavior, the boys are taught to play musical instruments. \\"Had something like this been in Long Beach,\\" Snoop tells Sister Shirley, \\"I would have been here instead of the street.\\"</span></p><p><span style=\\"line-height: 1.45em;\\">Another scene compares the block Peter Tosh and Bob Marley lived on with Snoop\'s old \'hood. Both blocks\' residents are intensely proud of their location, and Snoop tells the Jamaican residents he understands the concept of neighborhood pride. When someone from another block confronts Snoop regarding a perceived disrespect, Snoop quickly and easily deflates the situation. Things might not have been so quick and easy in Long Beach.\\u00A0</span></p><p><span style=\\"line-height: 1.45em;\\">Unfortunately, these moments of reflection and comparison are few. \\"Reincarnated\\" seems more interested in showing us countless scenes of people smoking herb than in giving us details about the making of the album it purports to be documenting.

Some he has acted in, some he has not. He has gotten the kind of attention young artists dream about, some good, some bad, festival awards, critical raves and critical derision. As an actor, Dolan has a blank and beautiful quality reminiscent of the young Alain Delon, whose almost otherworldly good looks were show-stopping and yet somehow off-putting as well (utilized to great effect in Jean-Paul Melville\'s \\"Le Samoura\\u00EF\\"). Audiences are drawn to such cinematic beauty, but can also be envious, and slightly hostile. (Alfred Hitchcock loved to fill his films with beautiful people and then make horrible things happen to them.) Is there anything there behind that mask of pure beauty?\\u00A0Dolan\'s latest, \\"Tom at the Farm\\" was completed several years ago (before last year\'s \\"Mommy\\") and is the first time he has adapted an extant work for the screen. Based on a play written by Michel Marc Bouchard (and Bouchard wrote the adaptation with Dolan), the adaptation appears to adhere closely to the original (I have not seen the play), with only a couple of scenes where the action is \\"opened up.\\" (Those scenes, on the whole, are not successful.) \\"Tom at the Farm\\" strains to be a psychological thriller but its length (102 minutes) dissipates the tension that should be taut and compressed. This is Dolan\'s first attempt at genre, and while there is much to admire here (mainly the visuals and the score, both stunning), Dolan\'s interests lie in the strange undercurrents of sado-masochism between the two main characters, and it\'s a through-line that deserves more attention. That through-line could have carried the entire movie if Dolan had let go of being faithful to the original.\\u00A0Tom (Dolan) drives through serene and brightly-colored autumn fields to attend the funeral of his boyfriend Guillaume. Once he arrives and meets Guillaume\'s mother Agathe (Lise Roy, who gives the best performance in the film), he learns that his boyfriend was closeted to his mother and had lied that he had a girlfriend. Tom is a greasy-haired boy, dressed in black leather and huge black boots, clomping through the immaculate farmhouse and the rural surrounding environment, a slash of black against the yellow dying corn. Agathe is eager to meet someone who knew her son, but confused and hurt that the never-met girlfriend did not attend the funeral.\\u00A0The emotional pressure in that farmhouse is so extreme that Tom is roped into going along with his dead boyfriend\'s lie. Tom closets himself, in other words. He decides not to read the shaky eulogy he is seen writing in the first image of the film. It\'s an uneasy choice for him to make. More problems arise when Francis (Pierre-Yves Cardinal), Guillaumes\'s swaggering older brother, who still lives at home with his mother, struts into the kitchen bare-chested, seething with hostility towards the blonde urban interloper. Francis knew his brother\'s secret life, has homophobic contempt for it, and has banned all of the gay friends from coming to the funeral (there\'s a confrontation with one of them at the back of the church). Francis is so intimidating, so awful really, that it\'s strange that Tom doesn\'t just leave immediately after the funeral. But the farm exerts a pull on Tom (the real story of the film). Tom is hypnotized into the dysfunctional workings of the family, their subverted energies working on him like a drug. He can\'t seem to leave. The only time he shows rage and frustration is when he is alone in his car after the funeral. Agathe becomes increasingly frayed. Francis picks fights with Tom, one particularly horrible one in the cornfield, with Tom getting torn to shreds by the razor-sharp dead corn stalks. In one terrible moment, Francis spits into Tom\'s open mouth. But one day, Francis teaches Tom how to milk cows. Then another day, Tom helps birth a calf, and cries with emotion afterwards. Francis reveals that he used to take dance classes, and in one haunting scene, Francis and Tom ballroom dance through the empty barn, Francis dipping Tom back gallantly, the scene moving to romantic slo-mo.\\u00A0What Dolan appears to be going for is a portrait of what could be seen as Stockholm Syndrome or perhaps the beginnings of a possible folie \\u00E0 deux\\u00A0situation. Francis and Tom hate each other, want to be each other, role-reverse, flirt, lash out. Tom is relatively submissive to Francis, taking the beatings, even encouraging them, and Francis senses that, takes pleasure in it. There\'s a sexual dance going on throughout, reminiscent of the murdering duo Leopold and Loeb (especially in the portrayal of the characters in 1959\'s \\"Compulsion\\", highlighting the hypnotic cult-like Master-Slave dynamic), or the novels of Patricia Highsmith, filled with doubling isolated characters. Francis won\'t let Tom leave, throwing obstacles in his way. Tom\'s cell phone doesn\'t work. He doesn\'t just walk down to the main road and hitch a ride. He stays. Francis has no friends, Francis hates gay people, swaggers like a rooster, glories in his singularity. But Tom\'s beautiful blank face before him is dying\\u00A0to be punched, or kissed, or marked in some way. These are the best sections of the film. It\'s really the story, and Dolan\'s intense interest in them is clear in the lingering way these scenes are shot.But as the film continues on and on (it\'s way too long), and Sarah (Evelyne Brochu), a city friend of Tom\'s shows up, pretending to be the girlfriend in order to put Agathe\'s mind at ease, \\"Tom at the Farm\\" unravels. There\'s not enough structure to these different threads. It could work on the stage where movement and place and time are necessarily compressed, but on film it feels artificial, not fully worked out.\\u00A0Beautiful visuals abound throughout (Andr\\u00E9 Turpin, who also shot \\"Mommy\\", is the cinematographer), and there\'s a moody high-contrast look to the landscape (bright trees and bright corn behind dark shadows and fog) that speaks of secrets, torment, hope. The lush and heavy-on-the-strings score of Gabriel Yared is a clue to what Dolan was after. The score punctuates all of the scenes, casual or intense, adding portentous emotion, tension, fear of what is coming. It\'s a melodramatic score, and \\"Tom at the Farm\\" works when it is a family melodrama. These are out-there people with outrageous emotional lives, subsisting on lies and denial, and the abyss between what they think their lives are and what their lives', 'i>really</i', 'are is enormous. All of them choose denial. They get tied to one another by their shared lies, and their unspoken agreement to keep on lying. The score supports that uneasy and terrible energy. The visuals, like the score, are exaggerated and stylistic, starting off with the helicopter shot following Tom\'s car into the countryside, making him seem dwarfed by the surrounding land, a tiny figure entering an unknown isolated world. It\'s a nod to Hitchcock or Kubrick.\\u00A0The thriller elements, the chase scenes, the reveal of horrifying secrets, feel like add-ons, clumsily done and unmotivated, especially when compared to the dark and deep dance (metaphorical and literal) of violence and sex going on between Tom and Francis. That\'s the real juice and guts of the film. It could be an answer to the nagging question throughout: Why the hell doesn\'t Tom just leave? In thrillers, people are always making ridiculous choices that go against their self-interest, or ignoring the red flags in front of them of potential predators. In a well-done thriller, you mostly forgive the unreal quality of these moments. But \\"Tom at the Farm\\" does not foreground the thriller aspect enough (although the score tries mightily to do so), and so Tom doesn\'t seem quite real. Nobody does.\\n\\n  Advertisement\\n  \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n            googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\'div-gpt-ad-block-atf-inline\'); });\\n          \\n        \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n"@en', 'https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/tom-at-the-farm-2015')

The fact that writer/director Analeine Cal y Mayor has created a whimsical little comedy out of a boy who goes through life smelling like fish is one of the main delights of \\"Treading Water.\\" Cal y Mayor takes a light touch, bordering on the surreal.

Mica\'s parents are played by Ariadna Gil and Don McKellar (\\"Slings and Arrows\\" fans will remember his turn as the ridiculously pretentious guest-director Darren Nichols.) Worried about why their son smells so bad, they take him to a round of doctors and quacks and gurus, who suggest using a specific soap, or who do weird rituals over his head in a candle-lit room. As the child grows, he is bullied at school. He knows he smells so he spends most of his time soaking in the bathtub, sometimes submerging himself completely where he swims around in a dreamy blue world of freedom. By the time Mica is a teenager, his father has abandoned the family, and Mica has isolated himself, spending most of his time at the local pool. He wears an air-freshener around his neck. He talks about his life with his therapist (Carrie Anne Moss). He has a crush on a girl he met at the pool (Zo\\u00EB Kravitz), who remembers him from grade-school. He hesitates to pursue her. Because he smells.\\u00A0Yes, it is all a bit silly, and the silliness is underlined by the house in which Mica and his mother live. It is the home of a famous Mexican singer named Guillermo Garibai (Gonzalo Vega), turned into a museum. Mica\'s mother gives tours. The walls are covered with kitschy portraits of Garibai and framed gold records, and the decor has not been updated since Garibai lived there in the late 1960s and early 1970s. To walk from the living room to the kitchen you have to swerve around all of the velvet ropes. Garibai fans show up at the door in small groups, dressed to the nines, sporting beehive hairdos and colorful dresses. If you\'ve visited Graceland, you know the type. Garabai was their hero, their heartthrob, and they Ooh and Aah over every \\"relic\\" saved in the house, even a broken cologne bottle, preserved under glass. Mica grows up with people wandering randomly through his bedroom (\\"and this is the room where Garibai was inspired to write his most famous song\\"), interrupting his bath time. Elisa Sauve was the production designer and the set of that house is such a weird and loopy environment that it automatically signals that none of this should be taken <i>too</i> seriously. Yes, the poor boy smells like fish and he has no friends, and yes, all of these bad things happen to his mother and father, but get a load of that house! Cal y Mayor', 'i>milks</i', 'that set. She finds every bit of humor possible in having her lead character live in an environment devoted to the idolization of the Mexican Elvis whose hey-day was 40 years before.Mica and Laura\'s romance is tentative. Both of them are keeping secrets from the other. But nothing is too intense. The romance is not the greatest love of all time, and Mica is more of a passive recipient of events rather than an active participant, a problem with the performance. His stakes always seem pretty low. He has accepted his lot in life. He smells like fish. There is no cure. Mica continues to swirl around underneath the water in the pool, freed up from the dry-day world that recoils from him. The whimsy of the directorial style helps save \\"Treading Water\\" from being a Disease of the Week television movie.\\u00A0  \\n    Advertisement\\n    \\n          \\n          \\n            \\n              googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\\"div-gpt-ad-block-btf-inline\\"); });\\n            \\n          \\n    \\n  \\n\\n\\"Treading Water\\" reminded me a bit of Arvin Chen\'s bittersweet comedy \\"Will You Still Love Me\\u00A0Tomorrow?\\" about a gay man who decides to get married and live as a straight man. \\u00A0A serious topic, filled with emotional mayhem, but Chen filmed it as a brightly-colored fable, romantic and cinematic, complete with dream sequences and choreographed musical numbers, people opening red umbrellas and floating up into the sky like Mary Poppins.

These sessions beget \\u201CHitchcock/Truffaut,\\u201D a book whose raison d\'\\u00EAtre was to show American critics that they were underestimating the cinematic richness of Hitchcock\\u2019s work. At the time, Hitchcock had been deemed a director of entertaining movies, lacking substance and importance. Despite his fifth directing Oscar nod for \\u201CPsycho,\\u201D Hitchcock was mainly seen as a director for the unwashed masses of general audiences. Truffaut aimed to fix that, and the resulting book is a master class in the fine art of directing, filled with photographs and the Master of Suspense\\u2019s candid observations of his oeuvre. Since its first edition published in 1966, \\u201CHitchcock/Truffaut\\u201D has been a staple and a fixture of any cinephile\\u2019s bookshelf.\\n\\n  Advertisement\\n  \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n            googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\'div-gpt-ad-block-atf-inline\'); });\\n          \\n        \\n  \\n\\n\\nFast-forward to 2015, where film critic and documentarian Kent Jones brings us the movie version of this essential book. Jones\\u2019 take on \\u201CHitchcock/Truffaut\\u201D is equal parts adaptation, CliffsNotes guide and commentary by a slew of directors influenced by Hitchcock\\u2019s work. The film is also a completely entertaining and informative gift to movie lovers, a work constructed with care, humor and insight. Though Hitchcock made his last movie (\\u201CFamily Plot\\") 40 years ago, he continues to influence in an almost transparent manner. Hitchcock is in the air that today\\u2019s directors breathe, and \\u201CHitchcock/Truffaut\\u201D aims to remind us of this fact.Jones supplements his film clips and interviews with audio from the original 27 hours of interview recordings (17 hours of which are available online). We hear Hitchcock discuss, in directorial terms, movies such as \\u201CSabotage,\\u201D \\u201CVertigo\\u201D and \\u201CThe Lodger.\\u201D We also hear Truffaut describing a scene from \\u201CThe 400 Blows\\u201D as a follow-up to Hitch\\u2019s description of \\u201Csuspense vs. surprise.\\u201D\\u00A0This is one of the most interesting passages in the film, a moment where the interviewer and the subject exchange places, comparing notes as footage of Truffaut\\u2019s film plays onscreen. Throughout \\u201CHitchcock/Truffaut,\\u201D one gets the feeling that the visual nature of directing forces a filmmaker to deal with his or her obsessions, explicitly or implicitly.\\u201CIf you think you can hide your prurient interests as a director, you\\u2019re crazy,\\u201D says David Fincher, one of several directors testifying before the camera. Fincher marvels at how blatantly Hitchcock expressed his own psychological traumas and aforementioned interests, several of which revolved around fear and sex. The famous story of how Hitchcock\\u2019s father had him locked up by Scotland Yard as a child is recounted here, and Hitchcock\\u2019s description of Kim Novak\\u2019s famous transformation scene in \\u201CVertigo\\u201D has a frank sexuality that\\u2019s as accurate as it is racy.\\u00A0In James Gray\\u2019s opinion, this scene contains \\u201Cthe greatest shot in the history of cinema.\\u201D  \\n    Advertisement\\n    \\n          \\n          \\n            \\n              googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\\"div-gpt-ad-block-btf-inline\\"); });\\n            </script>\\n          </div>\\n    </div>\\n  </article>\\n\\n<p>\\u201CHitchcock/Truffaut\\u201D spends a fair amount of time on \\u201CVertigo\\u201D, which isn\\u2019t surprising given that film\\u2019s current placement atop the Sight and Sound list. <a href=\\"/cast-and-crew/paul-schrader\\">Paul Schrader</a> calls it \\u201C<i>a forbidden document.</i>\\u201D <a href=\\"/cast-and-crew/martin-scorsese\\">Martin Scorsese</a> discusses how difficult it was to get a copy of the film screened back in the \'60s, as Hitchcock\\u2019s films were looked at with scorn and derision by the art theaters of the day.\\u00A0Since the film was not a success upon first run, Hitchcock sounds a bit reserved when talking about the film; people didn\\u2019t discuss their flops back then. \\u201C<i>You have a problem with it?</i>\\u201D asks Truffaut. Hitchcock responds that he took issue with \\u201C<i>the hole in the story</i>\\u201D regarding the murderer. This is an interesting contrast to his view on the numerous plot holes in hits like \\u201CNorth by Northwest.\\" \\u201C<i>I have this saying,</i>\\u201D he tells Truffaut in regard to those who complain about implausibility: \\u201C<i>Logic is dull.</i>\\u201D</p><p>Throughout \\u201CHitchcock/Truffaut\\u201D, Jones gives us delicious quotes from the interview. \\"\'<i>The Lodger\' is the first movie where I exercised any style,\\"</i>\\u00A0says the man who started out in silent movies when he was 23. Before directing, Hitchcock wrote dialogue titles and used his engineering background to draw and layout scenes. Truffaut suggests that those who started out as silent film directors know something that those who started out in the sound era will never know. The lack of sound forced a purer evocation of the cinema as a visual medium. \\u201C<i>You can watch a Hitchcock movie with the sound off,</i>\\u201D we\\u2019re told, \\u201C<i>and you\\u2019ll still be able to follow it.</i>\\u201D</p><p>This notion extends to the use of the suspense element for which Hitchcock is most known. The visuals transcend the language barrier. \\u201C<i>The Japanese audience should scream at the same time the Indian audience does,</i>\\u201D Hitchcock says. Jones uses a', 'a href=\\"/cast-and-crew/tippi-hedren\\">Tippi Hedren</a> scene from \\u201CThe Birds\\u201D to supplement Hitchcock\\u2019s discussion on how he uses space and an actor\\u2019s place within it to heighten tension, bringing out a particular element that I hadn\\u2019t noticed in the numerous times I\\u2019d seen the film.</p><p>\\u201CHitchcock/Truffaut\\u201D offers a lot of ideas to contemplate and discuss, especially if you\\u2019re a lover of Hitchcock\\u2019s works. Its most intriguing takeaway is a question Hitchcock posed to Truffaut. In so many words, he wonders if he should have experimented more with characters and if he had become \\u201C<i>a prisoner of my own form</i>.\\u201D It\\u2019s a fascinating question, one I carried with me after I left the theater. Wisely, Jones doesn\\u2019t provide any answers, for there isn\\u2019t a definitive one to be had.

For the price of a ticket, you can choose the level and nature of your vicarious involvement with the sadism on the screen, and the masochism in your seat. Enjoy.The game\'s narrative parameters are as follows: A dubiously American bourgeois family -- Ann (Naomi Watts), George (Tim Roth), their pre-teen son Georgie (Devon Gearhart) and their golden retriever -- arrive at their vacation home on Long Island. They are upper-class ciphers who stock soy milk in the refrigerator, feed their dog expensive Wellness brand kibble and keep a Tivoli radio in the kitchen. The attention paid to the details of their conspicuous consumption may or may not express the film\'s attitude: that these cardboard caricatures somehow deserve to be humiliated, tormented and killed for exhibiting Eurocentric yuppie tastes, including implicitly sinful predilections for golf, boating and classical music. Or maybe the movie is simply suggesting that you give yourself permission to feel that way.Two symbolic young men, Paul (Michael Pitt) and Peter (Brady Corbett), show up at the screen door, dressed in shorts, canvas shoes, white sweaters and white gloves. They proceed, politely and methodically, to terrorize, torture and murder their hostages, offering a rigged \\"bet,\\" in the guise of \\"entertainment,\\" on behalf of the film: that all family members will be dead by a certain hour. Meanwhile, the victims are bludgeoned into submission and despair. The torturers are blandly passive-aggressive and genteel, their motiveless actions appearing alternately logical and irrational, inexorable and impulsive, cruel and -- even more cruelly -- kind.

As an academic exercise in learned helplessness, the film flaunts the ultimate power to rewrite its own \\"rules\\" whenever it likes, including taking back anything that has already been shown. A movie with no restrictions holds no real suspense, and no surprises, so any revelation of plot details in, say, a review, is meaningless.What makes \\"Funny Games\\" different than any other campy-scary horror movie that gets off on tormenting its characters and teasing its audience? Not much. It\'s being pitched to the \\"Hostel\\" crowd (who are invited to laugh) and the art-house crowd (who are invited to feel ennobled as they shake their heads and lament the state of violence in movies).Haneke (whose masterworks include \\"Code Unknown\\" and \\"Cache\\") explains that his distinctively European film is \\"a reaction to ... the way American cinema toys with human beings ... [so that] violence is made consumable.\\" That\'s true, and it\'s what \\"Funny Games\\" sets out to do, but Haneke\'s essay fails because he hasn\'t a clue about what makes American movies tick. \\"Funny Games\\" doesn\'t seduce you with conventional storytelling and character development and then turn them around on you -- like, say, Alfred Hitchcock\'s \\"Rear Window\\" and \\"Psycho.\\" Instead, as the press kit explains, it encourages its viewers \\"to see their own role through a series of emotional and analytical episodes.\\" In other words, this isn\'t a movie, it\'s a thesis.\\"Funny Games\\" represents the laborious execution of an abstract notion. The concept is the movie, kind of like Andy Warhol\'s \'\'Empire\'\' (1964), an eight-hour stationary shot of the Empire State Building.

Where are the ooohs and ahhhs? \\"The Lost World: Jurassic Park\\" demonstrates even more clearly than \\"Jurassic Park\'\' (1993) that the underlying material is so promising, it deserves a story not written on autopilot. Steven Spielberg, a gifted filmmaker, should have reimagined the material, should have seen it through the eyes of someone looking at dinosaurs, rather than through the eyes of someone looking at a box-office sequel.\\n\\n  Advertisement\\n  \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n            googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\'div-gpt-ad-block-atf-inline\'); });\\n          \\n        \\n  \\n\\n\\nThe movie is well done from a technical viewpoint, yes. The dinosaurs look amazingly real, and we see them plunge into the midst of 360-degree action; a man on a motorcycle even rides between the legs of a running beast. It can be said that the creatures in this film transcend any visible signs of special effects and seem to walk the earth. But the same realism isn\'t brought to the human characters, who are bound by plot conventions and action formulas, and scripted to do stupid things so that they can be chased and sometimes eaten by the dinosaurs.Maybe it was already too late. Perhaps the time to do the thinking on this project was before the first film, when all the possibilities lay before Spielberg. He should have tossed aside the original Michael Crichton novel, knowing it had given him only one thing of use: an explanation for why dinosaurs might walk among us. Everything else--the scientific mumbo-jumbo, the theme park scheme--was just the recycling of other movies. We know the tired old plot lessons already, about man\'s greed and pride, and how it is punished, and why it does not pay to interfere with Mother Nature.Why not a pseudo-documentary in which the routine plot elements are simply ignored, and the characters venture into the unknown and are astonished and frightened by what they find? There are moments in the first \\"Jurassic Park\'\' which capture a genuine sense of wonder, the first time we see the graceful, awesome prehistoric creatures moving in stately calm beyond the trees. But soon they are cut down to size by a plot which has them chasing and scaring the human characters, as in any monster movie.  \\n    Advertisement\\n    \\n          \\n          \\n            \\n              googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\\"div-gpt-ad-block-btf-inline\\"); });\\n            </script>\\n          </div>\\n    </div>\\n ', '/article>\\n\\n<p>\\"The Lost World\'\' is even more perfunctory. The plot sets up a reason for a scientist (<a href=\\"/cast-and-crew/jeff-goldblum\\">Jeff Goldblum</a>) to return to an island where dinosaurs survive. His girlfriend (<a href=\\"/cast-and-crew/julianne-moore\\">Julianne Moore</a>) is already there. He takes along an equipment specialist and a \\"video documentarian\'\' (who comes equipped with a tiny tourist toy of a video camera and doesn\'t seem sure how to use it). They land on the island, are soon photographing prehistoric creatures, and so careless is the screenplay that the newcomers to the plot are not even allowed to express their amazement the first time they see their prey.</p><p>Much of the film, especially the action scenes, is shot at night in the rain. I assume that\'s to provide better cover for the special effects; we see relatively few dinosaurs in bright light, and the conceit is taken so far that even the press conference announcing a new dinosaur park in San Diego is held in the middle of the night. The night scenes also allow Spielberg to use his most familiar visual trademark, the visible beams from powerful flashlights, but apart from that touch, Spielberg doesn\'t really seem present in the picture: This feels like the kind of sequel a master hands over to an apprentice, and you sense that although much effort was lavished on the special effects, Spielberg\'s interest in the story was perfunctory.</p><p>Here\'s the key to the movie\'s weakness: Many elaborate sequences exist only to be . . . elaborate sequences. In a better movie, they would play a role in the story. Consider the drawn-out episode of the dangling research trailer, for example, which hangs over a cliff while the characters dangle above a terrifying drop and a hero tries to save the trailer from falling, while a dinosaur attacks. This is only what it seems to be, an action sequence. Nothing more. It doesn\'t lead into or out of anything, and is not necessary, except to fill screen time. It plays like an admission that the filmmakers couldn\'t think of something more intriguing involving the real story line.</p', ' <article class=\\"ad\\">\\n    <header><p>Advertisement</p></header>\\n    <div id=\\"ad-review-bottom\\" class=\\"ad-wrapper\\">\\n          <!-- /29848019/ROS_INL_MR_2 -->\\n          <div id=\\"div-gpt-ad-block-btf-inject1\\" style=\'height:250px; width:300px;\'>\\n            <script>\\n              googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\\"div-gpt-ad-block-btf-inject1\\"); });\\n            \\n          \\n    \\n  \\n\\nConsider, too, the character of Goldblum\'s daughter (Vanessa Lee Chester). Why is she here? To be placed in danger, to inspire contrived domestic disagreements, and to make demands so that the plot can get from A to B. At one point, inside the trailer, she gets frightened and says urgently that she \\"wants to go someplace real high--right now! Right now!\'\' So Goldblum and another character put her in a cage that lifts them above the forest, after which Goldblum must descend from the cage, after which I was asking why they had ascended in it in the first place. (Early in the film, it is established that the girl is a gymnast; later the film observes the ancient principle that every gymnast in a movie sooner or later encounters a bar.) There are some moments that work. Pete Postlethwaite, as a big game hunter who flies onto the island with a second wave of dinosaur mercenaries, doesn\'t step wrong; he plays a convincing if shallow character, even if he\'s called upon to make lengthy speeches in speeding Jeeps, and to utter arty lines about \\"movable feasts\'\' and having \\"spent enough time in the company of death.\'\' He alone among the major characters seems convinced that he is on an island with dinosaurs, and not merely in a special-effects movie about them.The film\'s structure is weird. I thought it was over, and then it began again, with a San Diego sequence in which Spielberg seemed to be trying to upstage the upcoming \\"Godzilla\'\' movie. The monster-stepping-on-cars sequences in the current Japanese import \\"Gamera: Guardian of the Universe\'\' are more entertaining. And can we really believe that a ship could ram a pier at full speed and remain seaworthy? The problem with the movie is that the dinosaurs aren\'t allowed to be the stars. They\'re marvelously conceived and executed, but no attempt is made to understand their fearsomeness; much of the plot hinges on mommy and daddy T-rexes exhibiting parental feelings for their offspring. Must we see everything in human terms? At one point, one character tells another, \\"These creatures haven\'t walked the earth for tens of millions of years, and now all you want to do is shoot them?\'\' Somebody could have asked Spielberg the same question.\\n\\n"@en', 'https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-lost-world-jurassic-park-1997')

Some he has acted in, some he has not. He has gotten the kind of attention young artists dream about, some good, some bad, festival awards, critical raves and critical derision. As an actor, Dolan has a blank and beautiful quality reminiscent of the young Alain Delon, whose almost otherworldly good looks were show-stopping and yet somehow off-putting as well (utilized to great effect in Jean-Paul Melville\'s \\"Le Samoura\\u00EF\\"). Audiences are drawn to such cinematic beauty, but can also be envious, and slightly hostile. (Alfred Hitchcock loved to fill his films with beautiful people and then make horrible things happen to them.) Is there anything there behind that mask of pure beauty?\\u00A0Dolan\'s latest, \\"Tom at the Farm\\" was completed several years ago (before last year\'s \\"Mommy\\") and is the first time he has adapted an extant work for the screen. Based on a play written by Michel Marc Bouchard (and Bouchard wrote the adaptation with Dolan), the adaptation appears to adhere closely to the original (I have not seen the play), with only a couple of scenes where the action is \\"opened up.\\" (Those scenes, on the whole, are not successful.) \\"Tom at the Farm\\" strains to be a psychological thriller but its length (102 minutes) dissipates the tension that should be taut and compressed. This is Dolan\'s first attempt at genre, and while there is much to admire here (mainly the visuals and the score, both stunning), Dolan\'s interests lie in the strange undercurrents of sado-masochism between the two main characters, and it\'s a through-line that deserves more attention. That through-line could have carried the entire movie if Dolan had let go of being faithful to the original.\\u00A0Tom (Dolan) drives through serene and brightly-colored autumn fields to attend the funeral of his boyfriend Guillaume. Once he arrives and meets Guillaume\'s mother Agathe (Lise Roy, who gives the best performance in the film), he learns that his boyfriend was closeted to his mother and had lied that he had a girlfriend. Tom is a greasy-haired boy, dressed in black leather and huge black boots, clomping through the immaculate farmhouse and the rural surrounding environment, a slash of black against the yellow dying corn. Agathe is eager to meet someone who knew her son, but confused and hurt that the never-met girlfriend did not attend the funeral.\\u00A0The emotional pressure in that farmhouse is so extreme that Tom is roped into going along with his dead boyfriend\'s lie. Tom closets himself, in other words. He decides not to read the shaky eulogy he is seen writing in the first image of the film. It\'s an uneasy choice for him to make. More problems arise when Francis (Pierre-Yves Cardinal), Guillaumes\'s swaggering older brother, who still lives at home with his mother, struts into the kitchen bare-chested, seething with hostility towards the blonde urban interloper. Francis knew his brother\'s secret life, has homophobic contempt for it, and has banned all of the gay friends from coming to the funeral (there\'s a confrontation with one of them at the back of the church). Francis is so intimidating, so awful really, that it\'s strange that Tom doesn\'t just leave immediately after the funeral. But the farm exerts a pull on Tom (the real story of the film). Tom is hypnotized into the dysfunctional workings of the family, their subverted energies working on him like a drug. He can\'t seem to leave. The only time he shows rage and frustration is when he is alone in his car after the funeral. Agathe becomes increasingly frayed. Francis picks fights with Tom, one particularly horrible one in the cornfield, with Tom getting torn to shreds by the razor-sharp dead corn stalks. In one terrible moment, Francis spits into Tom\'s open mouth. But one day, Francis teaches Tom how to milk cows. Then another day, Tom helps birth a calf, and cries with emotion afterwards. Francis reveals that he used to take dance classes, and in one haunting scene, Francis and Tom ballroom dance through the empty barn, Francis dipping Tom back gallantly, the scene moving to romantic slo-mo.\\u00A0What Dolan appears to be going for is a portrait of what could be seen as Stockholm Syndrome or perhaps the beginnings of a possible folie \\u00E0 deux\\u00A0situation. Francis and Tom hate each other, want to be each other, role-reverse, flirt, lash out. Tom is relatively submissive to Francis, taking the beatings, even encouraging them, and Francis senses that, takes pleasure in it. There\'s a sexual dance going on throughout, reminiscent of the murdering duo Leopold and Loeb (especially in the portrayal of the characters in 1959\'s \\"Compulsion\\", highlighting the hypnotic cult-like Master-Slave dynamic), or the novels of Patricia Highsmith, filled with doubling isolated characters. Francis won\'t let Tom leave, throwing obstacles in his way. Tom\'s cell phone doesn\'t work. He doesn\'t just walk down to the main road and hitch a ride. He stays. Francis has no friends, Francis hates gay people, swaggers like a rooster, glories in his singularity. But Tom\'s beautiful blank face before him is dying\\u00A0to be punched, or kissed, or marked in some way. These are the best sections of the film. It\'s really the story, and Dolan\'s intense interest in them is clear in the lingering way these scenes are shot.But as the film continues on and on (it\'s way too long), and Sarah (Evelyne Brochu), a city friend of Tom\'s shows up, pretending to be the girlfriend in order to put Agathe\'s mind at ease, \\"Tom at the Farm\\" unravels. There\'s not enough structure to these different threads. It could work on the stage where movement and place and time are necessarily compressed, but on film it feels artificial, not fully worked out.\\u00A0Beautiful visuals abound throughout (Andr\\u00E9 Turpin, who also shot \\"Mommy\\", is the cinematographer), and there\'s a moody high-contrast look to the landscape (bright trees and bright corn behind dark shadows and fog) that speaks of secrets, torment, hope. The lush and heavy-on-the-strings score of Gabriel Yared is a clue to what Dolan was after. The score punctuates all of the scenes, casual or intense, adding portentous emotion, tension, fear of what is coming. It\'s a melodramatic score, and \\"Tom at the Farm\\" works when it is a family melodrama. These are out-there people with outrageous emotional lives, subsisting on lies and denial, and the abyss between what they think their lives are and what their lives', 'i>really</i', 'are is enormous. All of them choose denial. They get tied to one another by their shared lies, and their unspoken agreement to keep on lying. The score supports that uneasy and terrible energy. The visuals, like the score, are exaggerated and stylistic, starting off with the helicopter shot following Tom\'s car into the countryside, making him seem dwarfed by the surrounding land, a tiny figure entering an unknown isolated world. It\'s a nod to Hitchcock or Kubrick.\\u00A0The thriller elements, the chase scenes, the reveal of horrifying secrets, feel like add-ons, clumsily done and unmotivated, especially when compared to the dark and deep dance (metaphorical and literal) of violence and sex going on between Tom and Francis. That\'s the real juice and guts of the film. It could be an answer to the nagging question throughout: Why the hell doesn\'t Tom just leave? In thrillers, people are always making ridiculous choices that go against their self-interest, or ignoring the red flags in front of them of potential predators. In a well-done thriller, you mostly forgive the unreal quality of these moments. But \\"Tom at the Farm\\" does not foreground the thriller aspect enough (although the score tries mightily to do so), and so Tom doesn\'t seem quite real. Nobody does.\\n\\n  Advertisement\\n  \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n            googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\'div-gpt-ad-block-atf-inline\'); });\\n          \\n        \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n"@en', 'https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/tom-at-the-farm-2015')

I hadn\'t seen it in years, and remembered mostly the broad outlines, the one-liners, the romance between a middle-aged man and a high school girl. Seeing it again I realize it\'s more subtle, more complex, and not about love, but loss. There are a lot of songs on the soundtrack, but the one that speaks for the hero says \'\'they\'re playing songs of love, but not for me.\'\'\\n\\n  Advertisement\\n  \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n            googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\'div-gpt-ad-block-atf-inline\'); });\\n          \\n        \\n  \\n\\n\\nThe movie\'s May-November romance was criticized because Isaac (Woody Allen) and Tracy (Mariel Hemingway) seem to have so little in common. But she at least has what lovers need, an ability to idealize the other person, and that\'s his fatal lack in the relationship: He doesn\'t feel she\'s special enough, and he doesn\'t see a future for them. Urging her to go to London on a scholarship, he consoles her, \'\'you\'ll think of me as a fond memory.\'\' He spends half of their time together trying to break up, and finally succeeds, taking her to a soda fountain after school--a location with perfect irony, given her age--to tell her he loves another woman, which is not exactly true. \'\'Now I don\'t feel so good,\'\' she says, in one of several lines that Hemingway makes both simple and heartbreaking.Only later, too much later, does Isaac confess to a friend, \'\'I think I really missed a good bet when I let Tracy go.\'\' Well, maybe he did, or maybe he was right and there was no plausible future between a 42-year-old (however immature) and a 17-year-old. The movie isn\'t about that. It\'s about the cynicism and superficiality of the modern mating dance, and how all Isaac\'s glib sophistication can\'t save him from true feelings, when they come.His character is surrounded by other adults who inhabit the wreckage of relationships. Isaac\'s former wife (Meryl Streep) left him to live with a woman, and writes a best seller ridiculing their marriage and love life; we doubt her new relationship is sound if it leaves her so obsessed with the previous one. Yale (Michael Murphy), has been happily married for years, but is having an affair with Mary (Diane Keaton). Both men have the tactic of trying to escape from relationships by telling the woman it\'s for her own good. Allen has Mary tell Yale they have no future, right after Isaac has told Tracy the same thing. Yale even more or less gives Mary to Isaac, to get her off his hands (\'\'You\'d be great for her\'\'), and they have a little fling before Yale realizes he loves her after all.Neither man can deal with affection. Both hide behind words, but are powerless in the face of emotional truth. The movie is not really about love in the present, but love in the past--about the wistful pain when we realize we had a beautiful thing, and screwed it up. In a more conventional movie, Yale and Mary would be the central couple, and Isaac and Tracy would be their best friends; authors since Shakespeare have mirrored their heroic lovers with comedic counterpoints, but Allen\'s whole career is based on making the secondary characters heroic. The relationship of Isaac and Mary is not a romantic comedy, then, but complex and tricky, and unforgiving in the way it sees Isaac running in place because he doesn\'t know whether to run toward Mary or away from her.  \\n    Advertisement\\n    \\n          \\n          \\n            \\n              googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\\"div-gpt-ad-block-btf-inline\\"); });\\n            </script>\\n          </div>\\n    </div>\\n  </article>\\n\\n<p>It is at the same time a breathtaking hymn to the idea of being in love in Manhattan, a place Allen loves. The opening shot is a stunner, looking West across Central Park at dawn while Gershwin\'s \'\'Rhapsody in Blue\'\' does what it always does--makes us feel transcendent. The locations are like an anthology of Manhattan shrines: The characters visit the Guggenheim, Elaine\'s, Zabar\'s deli. They sit on a park bench at dawn beneath a towering bridge, and ride a carriage through Central Park, and row boats in the lagoon. They go to art movies and concerts and eat Chinese food in bed and play racquetball. Allen knows that songs are the soundtracks of our lives, and gives us not only \'\'But Not for Me\'\' but \'\'Sweet and Lowdown,\'\' \'\'I Got a Crush on You,\'\' \'\'Do Do Do,\'\' \'\'Lady Be Good,\'\' \'\'Embraceable You,\'\' \'\'Someone to Watch Over Me\'\' and, when Isaac runs and runs to the girl he finally realizes he loves, \'\'Strike Up the Band.\'\'</p><p>All of these locations and all of these songs would not have the effect they do without the widescreen black and white cinematography of', 'a href=\\"/cast-and-crew/gordon-willis\\">Gordon Willis</a>. This is one of the best-photographed movies ever made, and a compelling argument for letterboxing on home video, since many of the compositions exploit the full width of the screen. Consider, for example, the sweet little conversation Isaac and Tracy have in his apartment, in a pool of light in the lower left corner of the screen, while the empty apartment stretches out toward a spiral staircase on the right: How better to show Tracy bringing life into this vast but lonely home?</p><p>Some of the scenes are famous just because of Willis\' lighting. For example, the way Isaac and Mary walk through the observatory as if they\'re strolling among the stars or on the surface of the moon. Later, as their conversation gets a little lost, Willis daringly lets them disappear into darkness, and then finds them again with just a sliver of side-lighting.</p><p>Keaton, of course, was famous after \\"<a href=\\"/reviews/great-movie-the-godfather-1972\\">The Godfather</a>\\" (1972), but she became a star and won an Oscar in Allen\'s \\"<a href=\\"/reviews/great-movie-annie-hall-1977\\">Annie Hall</a>\\" (1977). \'\'Manhattan,\'\' made two years later, has echoes of Annie in Mary, but they\'re more a case of Keaton\'s personal mannerisms than of a similarity in the characters. Mary is less flighty, less a deliberate eccentric, more a woman who uses her bright intelligence as a shield against loneliness. She\'s too smart to cause trouble and too careless to stay out of it; she tells the married Yale she doesn\'t want him to leave his wife, she doesn\'t want to be a homebreaker, yet she loves him--and she\'s stuck on Sunday afternoons with no one to talk to or play with. \'\'It\'s just bad timing,\'\' she finally says. Her fling with Isaac is really based on their mutual isolation; they don\'t have anyone else to call.</p', ' <article class=\\"ad\\">\\n    <header><p>Advertisement</p></header>\\n    <div id=\\"ad-review-bottom\\" class=\\"ad-wrapper\\">\\n          <!-- /29848019/ROS_INL_MR_2 -->\\n          <div id=\\"div-gpt-ad-block-btf-inject1\\" style=\'height:250px; width:300px;\'>\\n            <script>\\n              googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\\"div-gpt-ad-block-btf-inject1\\"); });\\n            \\n          \\n    \\n  \\n\\nThis was Mariel Hemingway\'s first substantial role, and it won her an Oscar nomination. Like her character, she was just turning 18. Her performance is so direct, so artless, so without affect, that it goes straight to the heart of the matter. And her size plays an interesting role in the movie. She is, of course, taller than Allen, but the meaning of that difference is not as simple as the tall girl-short guy syndrome. Seeing them together on the screen, I was struck by how unconcealable she is, how her presence is such an inescapable fact; in social situations, Isaac tends to take cover, to hide behind his wit, to make guerrilla raids on conversations, and this girl at his side makes him so visible. She attracts enemy fire. Watch Isaac\'s face when Mary asks, \'\'And what do you do, Tracy?\'\' and she replies, \'\'I go to high school.\'\'Woody Allen, it is said, always plays the same character in his movies. This is unfair. He often has the same verbal facility, yes, and some of the same mannerisms, but Isaac here is seen very specifically as a man whose yearnings and insecurities are founded on a deep immaturity. He wants, but doesn\'t know what he wants. He quits his job in an attack of ethics, but has no back-up plan. Look at Allen\'s face in Isaac\'s final scene with Tracy, as he pleads with her to stay with him, to not go to London, even while he realizes he is simply being selfish. A lesser actor would have gone over the top in the pleading, and then overdone the disappointment. Allen finds the difficult, precise tone of a man who desires and regrets and yet actually does like this young woman enough to know she\'s doing the right thing. He had her but he lost her, and now they both know their time has passed. He isn\'t planning the future, but trying to rewrite the past. She\'ll think of him as a fond memory.\\n\\n"@en', 'https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-manhattan-1979')

Petitclerc passed away a decade ago, and he would\\u2019ve been thrilled to learn that the long belated project would become the first Hollywood film shot in Cuba since 1959, and that various scenes would be shot in the locations where Hemingway once resided.

Petitclerc\\u2019s fictionalized self is inexplicably renamed Ed Myers and played by Giovanni Ribisi in a performance so wooden, he occasionally resembles the wax dummy of Joseph Cotten. Myers owes his entire career to Hemingway, and has obsessed over crafting the perfect letter to his hero. When his girlfriend, Debbie (Minka Kelly), secretly mails the letter, Hemingway is so impressed with it that he calls Myers and invites him on a fishing trip. The fact that we never see the contents of the letter is a prime example of how the storytelling continuously keeps us at arm\\u2019s length, never allowing us to fully understand the bond that developed between these men.\\u00A0\\nRather than pause for a few beats that would allow Myers and Hemingway to feel each other out during their initial encounter, the film cuts abruptly to a comedic fishing sequence that is punctuated with a punchline delivered by Hemingway. Adrian Sparks does all he can with a role comprised of either wise platitudes or self-destructive outbursts. Take a fleeting glimpse at any given shot of Ribisi and Sparks aboard a boat, and you\\u2019d swear you were looking at Roy Scheider and Robert Shaw in \\u201CJaws\\u201D (albeit without a shark, alas). Sparks growls his lines with a campy surliness in scenes where he\\u2019s required to \\u201Cbe a prick,\\u201D and then turns on a dime to a paternal warmth when conversing with \\u201Cthe kid.\\u201D At age 41, Ribisi lacks the boyish qualities needed to be regarded as \\u201Ca kid,\\u201D and it\\u2019s worth noting that Petitclerc was in his 20s during the events depicted here. A series of forced chuckles and bare bottoms are utilized to suggest a sense of intimacy among the characters, but when it comes to delving into their relationships, the script remains at surface level. It\\u2019s clear that Petitclerc\\u2019s draft was in need of a rewrite.\\u00A0\\nPeter Greenaway\\u2019s \\u201CEisenstein in Guanajuato\\u201D may have fallen short as a biopic, but as a frank portrayal of a man\\u2019s sexual awakening, it was vividly realized and wholly memorable. There\\u2019s not a single frame of \\u201CPapa: Hemingway in Cuba\\u201D that is guaranteed to linger long in the memory. The director here is Bob Yari, who has found great success as a producer of terrific films such as \\u201CThumbsucker,\\u201D \\u201CThe Painted Veil\\u201D and \\u201CNothing But the Truth.\\u201D This is his first directorial credit since 1989\\u2019s \\u201CMind Games,\\u201D and on the basis of this picture, he should stick to producing. The film is not incompetent per se, aside from the truly awful sound design on the screener that I viewed (hopefully these errors will be cleaned up in subsequent prints). Dueling ambiences were clashing every time the characters opened their mouths, but more importantly, what they had to say just wasn\\u2019t very interesting. Here\\u2019s a film about one of the greatest writers in history that reduces the iconic man\\u2019s mind to the canned insights of a fortune cookie. In what should\\u2019ve been a compelling scene, Hemingway opens up to Myers about an act of infidelity that has haunted him throughout the years. \\u201CMake a decision carefully,\\u201D he cautions Myers. \\u201CConsider every consequence.\\u201D Contrast these generic declarations with Jason Robards\\u2019 shattering monologue in \\u201CMagnolia,\\u201D which recounts similar wounds with a rambling tone and naturalistic poetry that feels like it was ripped directly from the dying man\\u2019s soul.\\u00A0  \\n    Advertisement\\n    \\n          \\n          \\n            \\n              googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\\"div-gpt-ad-block-btf-inline\\"); });\\n            </script>\\n          </div>\\n    </div>\\n  </article>\\n\\n<p>\\n</p><p><a href=\\"/cast-and-crew/jason-isaacs\\">Jason Isaacs</a> once told me that no actor, however good, can make a bad script work, and I kept being reminded of his words while watching \\u201CPapa.\\u201D Faced with stilted dialogue, Sparks and', 'a href=\\"/cast-and-crew/joely-richardson\\">Joely Richardson</a', '(as Hemingway\\u2019s wife, Mary) overact in order to compensate.

How do we know this? Well, for one thing, there\'s a burglary right at the start.And the central character himself, Will Francis (Jude Law), demonstrates a fondness for metaphors in his dialogue. He\'s so fond of them that he even tells us he is fond of them in a climactic speech: \\"I don\'t even know how to be honest anymore. Maybe that\'s why I like metaphors.\\" Then he goes on to describe a metaphor, where a circle represents his family, but it\'s also an enclosure or a cage, and he wants to feel comfortable in it but sometimes he feels trapped in it and sometimes he feels excluded from it.\\n\\n  Advertisement\\n  \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n            googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\'div-gpt-ad-block-atf-inline\'); });\\n          \\n        \\n  \\n\\n\\nIt figures that Will is a partner in a London architecture and landscape design firm, since geometry looms so large in his consciousness. The guiding principle of his company, Green Effects, which is engaged in building a huge development in a squalid section of King\'s Cross, is to promote the concept of \\"built landscape as art, and one that requires as much care as any structure, and as much acknowledgment of design.\\" And there you have another metaphor for \\"Breaking and Entering,\\" a geometrical art-movie exercise defined by its structure and design.The players on Minghella\'s cinematic Parcheesi board are arranged as follows: Will is in a 10-year relationship with Liv (Robin Wright Penn), the Swedish-American mother of a 13-year-old girl, Bea (Poppy Rogers), a gymnast with borderline-autistic behavioral disorders. On the opposing side is Amira (Juliette Binoche), a Bosnian Muslim widow and refugee who lives in a housing project with her difficult 15-year-old son, Miro (Rafi Gavron), who is also a gymnast of sorts. Miro uses his gravity-defying parkour skills to climb and break into buildings to steal electronic equipment for his Serbian uncle\'s burglary operation. To use a metaphor, these two mothers and children are opposing mirrored reflections of each other: blond/brunet, Swedish/Bosnian, upper-class/ working-class, girl/boy ... and Will finds himself caught between them. The symmetry is almost perfect. Which is in part why it all feels so planned, more like an architectural blueprint than a movie.Every once in a while, to serve the higher call of the plotting, someone is called upon to make an utterly baffling and nonsensical move for no good reason. When Will, for example, leaves his business card with the mother of the boy he knows has been burgling his office and doesn\'t anticipate that the boy might feel just a bit paranoid and threatened by this mysterious gesture, you have to wonder how much humanity writer-director Minghella is willing to cede to his characters.To help reinforce the title metaphor, up pops a Romanian prostitute. She is Oana (Vera Farmiga), who abruptly enters Will\'s car one night when he and his partner Sandy (Martin Freeman) are staking out their own office to catch the burglars.  \\n    Advertisement\\n    \\n          \\n          \\n            \\n              googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\\"div-gpt-ad-block-btf-inline\\"); });\\n            \\n          \\n    \\n  \\n\\nNo, it makes no sense whatsoever that Will and Sandy, the heads of this large company, would sit in their parking lot all night like this, or that Oana would bring Will coffee and sit in his car and not even charge him, or ... well, that\'s not the point, is it? She\'s breaking and entering, don\'t you see? She\'s slipping into his car and into his life, getting him to lower the power-windows of his smooth-riding, shock-absorbed existence. But Oana is just a metaphor tricked out in a big, blond wig. Once we get the idea -- actually, long after we get the idea -- the plot drops her like a hot potato. (That\'s a simile, not a metaphor. It\'s also a cliche, and so is she.)With \\"Breaking and Entering,\\" Minghella (best known as the director of \\"The English Patient\\" and \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley,\\" starring Binoche and Law, respectively) seems to be trying his hand at a less ambitious Gonzalez Inarritu/Arriaga movie, like \\"Amores Perros\\" or \\"21 Grams\\" or \\"Babel,\\" with interlocking mini-stories that illustrate how people from different backgrounds affect each other\'s lives. But what are the meaningful connections between these people\'s lives? Are they real and significant, or are they just plot contrivances, the manipulation of pawns in an onscreen board game? The actors are fine, but what does it matter when all they\'re given to play are avatars?In the press notes, Jude Law spells it out: \\"The argument is: Is it worse to steal somebody\'s computer or is it worse to steal somebody\'s heart?\\" That\'s not even a decent metaphor (although, to be fair, the film is not about organ theft). It\'s simply an algebraic formulation: a > b or b ', 'a, where \\"a\\" is \\"computer,\\" \\"b\\" is \\"heart\\" and the nature of the relationship is \\"worse\\"?Expressed in those terms, \\"Breaking and Entering\\" \\n\\n"@en', 'https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/breaking-and-entering-2007')

This new installment in what could be a continuing Linson semi-franchise\\u2014\\u201CArt Linson\\u2019s Tales of Showbiz\\u201D\\u2014has a whole hell of a lot going for it in the individual ingredients department. Linson provided the storyline, which no doubt has any number of a clef elements. The co-screenwriters include Jeffrey Ross, the comedian and Friar\\u2019s Club figurehead who knows where dozens of bodies are buried, the great Richard LaGravenese, and Lewis Friedman, a veteran showbiz gagman and another repository of outrageous tales. Hackford has more than a few first-rate pictures under his belt, including 2004\\u2019s \\u201CRay\\u201D and the underseen \\u201CBlood In, Blood Out.\\u201D And the cast is spectacular, by 1980 standards and by those of 2016. Robert De Niro, Danny DeVito, Harvey Keitel (reuniting with De Niro for the first time since, um, \\u201CLittle Fockers\\u201D in 2010 if I\\u2019m not mistaken), Charles Grodin, Patti Lupone, Cloris Leachman and more, with Edie Falco and Leslie Mann playing the teen roles, relatively speaking. And two raft loads of cameos from real-life comedy legends as themselves.  But the movie never builds enough momentum, emotional or narrative, to get the viewer on its side. De Niro plays Jackie Burke, an aging comic at a career impasse. Like so many movies with aging casts, this one makes a lot of hay out of seniors trying to cope with the digital world. Jackie doesn\\u2019t do such a good job of coping when, one night at a sparsely attended gig, he discovers that a couple of hecklers are razzing him not just for the hell of it, but to provide fodder for their YouTube (or something) series. Jackie head-butts the guy in indignation and winds up battling an assault charge. During his community service (the battle didn\\u2019t go his way; he also ended up doing thirty days) he finds himself serving at a food kitchen alongside Mann\\u2019s Harmony, the troubled daughter of a one-time mobster played by Keitel. The two strike up a friendship that one desperately hopes does not blossom into a romance, while Jackie juggles money troubles, opportunities for gigs, and other challenges in a way that suggest that he thrives on self-defeat in a sense.  One of the movie\\u2019s problems is that it really doesn\\u2019t make clear the particulars of Jackie\\u2019s situation early on. We know that he had once acted the role of \\u201CEddie\\u201D in a popular television sitcom, and that the quasi-\\u201CHoneymooners\\u201D show made his name, his fandom, and whatever\\u2019s left of his fortune. But his existential/artistic quandary only becomes clear as the movie continues. By the time we seem Mann\\u2019s character looking at a vintage vinyl LP titled \\u201CThe Mind of Jackie Burke\\u201D do we understand that Jackie, more than being just a comic who worked blue but got a family television show anyway (think Bob Saget) was not just a shock comic but a social commentator (think George Carlin or even Lenny Bruce). Hackford gives us a lot of nice character notes for Jackie (I particularly liked the scene where he\\u2019s ironing his own clothes while listening to a very obscure Art Blakey LP), but saving this context for last leaves the character, and some of his decisions, a little murky.   \\n    Advertisement\\n    \\n          \\n          \\n            \\n              googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\\"div-gpt-ad-block-btf-inline\\"); });\\n            </script>\\n          </div>\\n    </div>\\n  </article>\\n\\n <p>Then there\\u2019s De Niro himself. The actor has been in a lot of less than good movies over the years, but rarely, or relatively rarely, has he been in movies in which his performance could be cited as a key problem, or lack. Pauline Kael famously excoriated his work in 1981\\u2019s \\u201C<a href=\\"/reviews/true-confessions-1981\\">True Confessions</a>,\\u201D writing \\u201CHe could be a potato, except he\\u2019s thoroughly absorbed in the process of doing nothing.\\u201D But she was a minority voice. As for De Niro\\u2019s work here, it is quite peculiar. In certain individual scenes, playing off DeVito as his much-beset brother, or Keitel\\u2019s boorish patriarchal non-fan, or Grodin as an estranged colleague, he gets a good spark going, at least for a while. But he can\\u2019t figure Burke out as a stand-up. He pitches his delivery somewhere awkwardly between his legendary \\u201CKing of Comedy\\u201D wannabe Rupert Pupkin and his legendary \\u201C<a href=\\"/reviews/midnight-run-1988\\">Midnight Run</a>\\u201D wisecracking bounty hunter <a href=\\"/cast-and-crew/jack-walsh\\">Jack Walsh</a>. And in a scene that\\u2019s sure to be widely cited, and widely disdained, he leads the members of a senior home in a profanely altered rendition of \\u201CMakin\\u2019 Whoopee\\u201D with the ill-advised relish of his work as Fearless Leader in that Rocky and Bullwinkle film of which I try not to speak of anymore. And it\\u2019s in this cartoonish mode that the movie ultimately ends, as he looks on proudly while the end result of a drunken evening of ill-advised whoopee cops the comedian\\u2019s style.

But the best noirs were made in the 1940s and 1950s, before\\ndirectors consciously knew what they were doing (\\u201CWe called them B movies,\\u201D\\nsaid Robert Mitchum).\\nOnce the French named the genre, once a generation of filmmakers\\ncame along who had seen noirs at cinematheques instead of in flea pits, noir\\ncould never again be naive. One of the joys of a great noir like \\u201CDetour\\u201D\\n(1954) is the feeling that it was made by people who took the story perfectly\\nseriously. One of the dangers of modern self-conscious noir, as Pauline Kael\\nwrote in her scathing dismissal of \\u201CBody Heat,\\u201D is that an actress like\\nKathleen Turner comes across \\u201Cas if she were following the marks on the floor\\nmade by the actresses who preceded her.\\u201D\\n\\n  Advertisement\\n  \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n            googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\'div-gpt-ad-block-atf-inline\'); });\\n          \\n        \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd\\nyet if bad modern noir can play like a parody, good noir still has the power to\\nseduce. Yes, Lawrence Kasdan\'s \\u201CBody Heat\\u201D (1981) is aware of the films that\\ninspired it--especially Billy Wilder\'s \\u201CDouble Indemnity\\u201D (1944). But it has a\\npower that transcends its sources. It exploits the personal style of its stars\\nto insinuate itself; Kael is unfair to Turner, who in her debut role played a\\nwoman so sexually confident that we can believe her lover (William Hurt) could\\nbe dazed into doing almost anything for her. The moment we believe that, the\\nmovie stops being an exercise and starts working. (I think the moment occurs in\\nthe scene where she leads Hurt by her hand in that manner a man is least\\ninclined to argue with.)\\nWomen\\nare rarely allowed to be bold and devious in the movies; most directors are\\nmen, and they see women as goals, prizes, enemies, lovers and friends, but\\nrarely as protagonists. Turner\'s entrance in \\u201CBody Heat\\u201D announces that she is\\nthe film\'s center of power. It is a hot, humid night in Florida. Hurt, playing\\na cocky but lazy lawyer named Ned Racine, is strolling on a pier where an\\nexhausted band is listlessly playing. He is behind the seated audience. We can\\nsee straight down the center aisle to the bandstand. All is dark and red and\\norange. Suddenly a woman in white stands up, turns around and walks straight\\ntoward him. This is Matty Walker. To see her is to need her.\\nTurner\\nin her first movie role was an intriguing original. Slender, with hair down to\\nher shoulders, she evoked aspects of Barbara Stanwyck and Lauren Bacall. But\\nthe voice, with its elusive hint of a Latin accent, was challenging.

It is important that the man not be a dummy; he needs to be\\nsmart enough to think of the plan himself.

The film\\nopens with an inn burning in the distance (\\u201CSomebody\'s torched it to clear the\\nlot,\\u201D Ned says. \\u201CProbably one of my clients.\\u201D) There are other fires. There is\\nthe use of the color red. There is the sense that heat inflames passion and\\nencourages madness.\\nIn\\nthis heat, Matty seems cool. Early in the film there is a justly famous scene\\nwhere Matty brings Ned home from a bar, allegedly to listen to her wind chimes,\\nand then asks him to leave. He leaves, then returns, and looks through a window\\nnext to her front door. She stands inside, dressed in red, calmly returning his\\ngaze. He picks up a chair and throws it through the window, and in the next\\nshot they are embracing. Knowing what we know about Matty, look once again at\\nher expression as she looks back at him. She looks as confident and absorbed as\\na child who has pushed a button and is waiting for a video game to respond.\\nKasdan,\\nborn in 1949, worked in ad agencies before moving to Hollywood to write\\nscreenplays.

Some he has acted in, some he has not. He has gotten the kind of attention young artists dream about, some good, some bad, festival awards, critical raves and critical derision. As an actor, Dolan has a blank and beautiful quality reminiscent of the young Alain Delon, whose almost otherworldly good looks were show-stopping and yet somehow off-putting as well (utilized to great effect in Jean-Paul Melville\'s \\"Le Samoura\\u00EF\\"). Audiences are drawn to such cinematic beauty, but can also be envious, and slightly hostile. (Alfred Hitchcock loved to fill his films with beautiful people and then make horrible things happen to them.) Is there anything there behind that mask of pure beauty?\\u00A0Dolan\'s latest, \\"Tom at the Farm\\" was completed several years ago (before last year\'s \\"Mommy\\") and is the first time he has adapted an extant work for the screen. Based on a play written by Michel Marc Bouchard (and Bouchard wrote the adaptation with Dolan), the adaptation appears to adhere closely to the original (I have not seen the play), with only a couple of scenes where the action is \\"opened up.\\" (Those scenes, on the whole, are not successful.) \\"Tom at the Farm\\" strains to be a psychological thriller but its length (102 minutes) dissipates the tension that should be taut and compressed. This is Dolan\'s first attempt at genre, and while there is much to admire here (mainly the visuals and the score, both stunning), Dolan\'s interests lie in the strange undercurrents of sado-masochism between the two main characters, and it\'s a through-line that deserves more attention. That through-line could have carried the entire movie if Dolan had let go of being faithful to the original.\\u00A0Tom (Dolan) drives through serene and brightly-colored autumn fields to attend the funeral of his boyfriend Guillaume. Once he arrives and meets Guillaume\'s mother Agathe (Lise Roy, who gives the best performance in the film), he learns that his boyfriend was closeted to his mother and had lied that he had a girlfriend. Tom is a greasy-haired boy, dressed in black leather and huge black boots, clomping through the immaculate farmhouse and the rural surrounding environment, a slash of black against the yellow dying corn. Agathe is eager to meet someone who knew her son, but confused and hurt that the never-met girlfriend did not attend the funeral.\\u00A0The emotional pressure in that farmhouse is so extreme that Tom is roped into going along with his dead boyfriend\'s lie. Tom closets himself, in other words. He decides not to read the shaky eulogy he is seen writing in the first image of the film. It\'s an uneasy choice for him to make. More problems arise when Francis (Pierre-Yves Cardinal), Guillaumes\'s swaggering older brother, who still lives at home with his mother, struts into the kitchen bare-chested, seething with hostility towards the blonde urban interloper. Francis knew his brother\'s secret life, has homophobic contempt for it, and has banned all of the gay friends from coming to the funeral (there\'s a confrontation with one of them at the back of the church). Francis is so intimidating, so awful really, that it\'s strange that Tom doesn\'t just leave immediately after the funeral. But the farm exerts a pull on Tom (the real story of the film). Tom is hypnotized into the dysfunctional workings of the family, their subverted energies working on him like a drug. He can\'t seem to leave. The only time he shows rage and frustration is when he is alone in his car after the funeral. Agathe becomes increasingly frayed. Francis picks fights with Tom, one particularly horrible one in the cornfield, with Tom getting torn to shreds by the razor-sharp dead corn stalks. In one terrible moment, Francis spits into Tom\'s open mouth. But one day, Francis teaches Tom how to milk cows. Then another day, Tom helps birth a calf, and cries with emotion afterwards. Francis reveals that he used to take dance classes, and in one haunting scene, Francis and Tom ballroom dance through the empty barn, Francis dipping Tom back gallantly, the scene moving to romantic slo-mo.\\u00A0What Dolan appears to be going for is a portrait of what could be seen as Stockholm Syndrome or perhaps the beginnings of a possible folie \\u00E0 deux\\u00A0situation. Francis and Tom hate each other, want to be each other, role-reverse, flirt, lash out. Tom is relatively submissive to Francis, taking the beatings, even encouraging them, and Francis senses that, takes pleasure in it. There\'s a sexual dance going on throughout, reminiscent of the murdering duo Leopold and Loeb (especially in the portrayal of the characters in 1959\'s \\"Compulsion\\", highlighting the hypnotic cult-like Master-Slave dynamic), or the novels of Patricia Highsmith, filled with doubling isolated characters. Francis won\'t let Tom leave, throwing obstacles in his way. Tom\'s cell phone doesn\'t work. He doesn\'t just walk down to the main road and hitch a ride. He stays. Francis has no friends, Francis hates gay people, swaggers like a rooster, glories in his singularity. But Tom\'s beautiful blank face before him is dying\\u00A0to be punched, or kissed, or marked in some way. These are the best sections of the film. It\'s really the story, and Dolan\'s intense interest in them is clear in the lingering way these scenes are shot.But as the film continues on and on (it\'s way too long), and Sarah (Evelyne Brochu), a city friend of Tom\'s shows up, pretending to be the girlfriend in order to put Agathe\'s mind at ease, \\"Tom at the Farm\\" unravels. There\'s not enough structure to these different threads. It could work on the stage where movement and place and time are necessarily compressed, but on film it feels artificial, not fully worked out.\\u00A0Beautiful visuals abound throughout (Andr\\u00E9 Turpin, who also shot \\"Mommy\\", is the cinematographer), and there\'s a moody high-contrast look to the landscape (bright trees and bright corn behind dark shadows and fog) that speaks of secrets, torment, hope. The lush and heavy-on-the-strings score of Gabriel Yared is a clue to what Dolan was after. The score punctuates all of the scenes, casual or intense, adding portentous emotion, tension, fear of what is coming. It\'s a melodramatic score, and \\"Tom at the Farm\\" works when it is a family melodrama. These are out-there people with outrageous emotional lives, subsisting on lies and denial, and the abyss between what they think their lives are and what their lives', 'i>really</i', 'are is enormous. All of them choose denial. They get tied to one another by their shared lies, and their unspoken agreement to keep on lying. The score supports that uneasy and terrible energy. The visuals, like the score, are exaggerated and stylistic, starting off with the helicopter shot following Tom\'s car into the countryside, making him seem dwarfed by the surrounding land, a tiny figure entering an unknown isolated world. It\'s a nod to Hitchcock or Kubrick.\\u00A0The thriller elements, the chase scenes, the reveal of horrifying secrets, feel like add-ons, clumsily done and unmotivated, especially when compared to the dark and deep dance (metaphorical and literal) of violence and sex going on between Tom and Francis. That\'s the real juice and guts of the film. It could be an answer to the nagging question throughout: Why the hell doesn\'t Tom just leave? In thrillers, people are always making ridiculous choices that go against their self-interest, or ignoring the red flags in front of them of potential predators. In a well-done thriller, you mostly forgive the unreal quality of these moments. But \\"Tom at the Farm\\" does not foreground the thriller aspect enough (although the score tries mightily to do so), and so Tom doesn\'t seem quite real. Nobody does.\\n\\n  Advertisement\\n  \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n            googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\'div-gpt-ad-block-atf-inline\'); });\\n          \\n        \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n"@en', 'https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/tom-at-the-farm-2015')

And in a town that already has one show about a precocious young tyke (an indifferently received revival of Annie) on the boards?  The answer, I suspect, is very much yes, as the New York theatre moves into awards-season overdrive in the race for this year\\u2019s Tony Awards.  Britain is usually responsible for producing plenty of Tony contenders, but not this year, where the Best Play nominees are likely to be a fully American quartet.  That means, in turn, that 10-year-old Milly Shapiro (the one of four Matildas performing in this Broadway production I saw) has a lot riding on her slight shoulders. And yet, as Roald Dahl\\u2019s diminutive character would be the first to make clear, mess with this little girl at your peril.  As directed by Matthew Warchus, Matilda has always been the little show that could.

At the same time, Bertie Carvel, making his Broadway debut, seems to have adjusted his award-winning termagant of a Trunchbull up a notch, his arm-flapping intensity lending the English actor the feel of a breast-plated whirligig.  But the tremendous heart and intelligence of the piece remains undimmed, and among the new recruits, special kudos must go to Gabriel Ebert\\u2019s Mr Wormwood: a lanky, sartorially challenged spiv with a knockout voice. And at the show\\u2019s capacious heart, one can only thrill to the tiny yet mightily determined Shapiro as she takes the audience on Matilda\\u2019s journey from a surrounding loutishness and neglect through to a world of learning, literature and, by the final curtain, love.

But Neil Armfield\\u2019s fine production, first seen at Hampstead last year, has turned a famous flop into a genuine hit, greatly helped by Rupert Everett\\u2019s brilliant and deeply felt performance as Wilde.  Saying that someone was born to play a particular role is a clich\\u00E9, but watching Everett here it also seems a statement of fact. For long sections of the play you feel that you are in the company of Oscar himself, first immediately after his libel case against the Marquess of Queensberry has collapsed, and then when he is reunited with Bosie in Naples after two punishing years of imprisonment.  Everett\\u2019s Wilde is an older, sadder and wiser man than the wicked wit of popular imagination, and even his moments of humour are shot through with deep melancholy and a passivity that paradoxically becomes dramatically enthralling as he awaits arrest at the Cadogan Hotel. Why did Wilde resist the chance to flee when he knew the game was up? Why after his hellish time in Reading Gaol did he resume his relationship with the faithless Bosie?  Hare suggests that the reason was unconditional love and Everett\\u2019s beautifully judged performance makes it clear that Wilde is aware of all Bosie\\u2019s faults, but for him love is neither to be calculated nor adjusted to circumstances. As he declares in one of the play\\u2019s most telling and affecting lines: \\u201CThe everyday world is shrouded. We see it dimly. Only when we love do we see the true person\\u2026 Love is not the illusion. Life is.\\u201D Watching this fine revival one realises with a jolt that the often prickly Hare is, like Wilde, a romantic at heart.  It is moving to watch Everett in the role, not least because his gilded youth is far behind him and in this production he finally seems to be redeeming an often squandered talent. I don\\u2019t know if he has been binging on pasta and ice cream or is artfully padded up, but he is plausibly obese, and beautifully captures the rueful wit and the valour of Wilde as he faces the bleakest of futures following Bosie\\u2019s last act of treachery. \\n\\t\\t\\tRelated Articles\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    The Judas Kiss, Hampstead Theatre, review\\n                \\n\\n\\t13 Sep 2012\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    The importance of being Rupert\\n                \\n\\n\\t01 Oct 2012\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    Oscar Wilde\\u2019s nemesis, the \\"scarlet\\" Marquess of Queensberry: review\\n                \\n\\n\\t02 Apr 2013\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    \'Nothing worse than gay dads,\' says Rupert Everett\\n                \\n\\n\\t16 Sep 2012\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t Freddie Fox is persuasive, too, as Wilde\\u2019s beloved nemesis, blond, petulant and heartless, yet convinced of his own righteousness, while Cal MacAninch is deeply touching as Wilde\\u2019s loyal friend and former lover, Robert Ross.

I can only say that the American dramatist Sarah Ruhl has come up with something rather wonderful: a period drama that is funny, original and genuinely touching. It is also based on historical fact.  In the late 19th century, many women (and a few men) were treated for hysteria with an electrical vibrator. They experienced orgasms, known as paroxysms, but it was regarded as a strictly medical procedure. Many of the women had never experienced sexual fulfilment in the marital bed and the treatment seemed to do them a power of good. Men were treated with a fearsome instrument called the Chattanooga that worked on the prostate gland and seemed to do the trick too.  The action is set in New York State where Dr Givings practices his calling in his upstairs consulting room, singing the praises of Thomas Edison as he goes about his work.  The contrast between the doctor\\u2019s briskly efficient manner and his patients\\u2019 groans and gasps of pleasure is often deliciously comic, but a suitably Victorian propriety prevails. There is no nudity, and the procedures all take place beneath a crisp white sheet. \\n\\t\\t\\tRelated Articles\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    Does masturbating really make people less creative?\\n                \\n\\n\\t07 Aug 2014\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    Eric and Little Ern: \'warm, funny and moving\'\\n                \\n\\n\\t21 Nov 2013\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    What makes a play popular?\\n                \\n\\n\\t22 Nov 2013\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t Downstairs in Dr Givings\\u2019s living room however matters are less happy. The doctor\\u2019s wife, Catherine, played with a beguiling mixture of wit, curiosity and sadness by Natalie Casey, has recently given birth to a baby girl but is unable to provide her child with enough milk. A black wet-nurse is called in, who is only able to provide the service because her own child died in infancy and the often strained relationship between these two bruised and unhappy women is most delicately caught. The play\\u2019s rich mixture is further enhanced by a lovelorn artist (an excellent Edward Bennett) who seeks treatment from the doctor and briefly captures the heart of his wife.  There is great tenderness in Ruhl\\u2019s portrayal of her beautifully observed characters and though there is a lot of pain in this play, there is a lot of laughter too. I particularly liked the scene in which the doctor\\u2019s wife, who is entirely ignorant of what goes on in her husband\\u2019s consulting room, opens the locked door with a hatpin and gets one of his patients (played by a now happily radiant Flora Montgomery) to show her what happens there. It\\u2019s a lovely moment of female solidarity, in which both women behave like naughty schoolgirls.  There is also a fine scene when they ask the wet nurse if she has ever experienced the feelings on offer in the consulting room, and the dignified black woman, movingly played by Madeline Appiah, says it sounds like what happens when husband and wife have \\u201Crelations\\u201D. Neither of the white characters can believe such a thing is possible.  Laurence Boswell\\u2019s outstanding production, with a delightfully detailed two-storey design by Simon Kenny, discovers all the play\\u2019s humour and moments of deeper feeling, and one leaves the theatre with a warm glow of pleasure.

There was a picturesque flurry of snow, Christmas lights twinkled, and, if I\\u2019m not mistaken, angels descended from the skies and sang madrigals. It was a deeply satisfying episode for fans who had become anxious after the wonky, half-cooked storylines of series two.  But romance couldn\\u2019t be the answer indefinitely, could it? Julian Fellowes, the writer, knows that while we love a happy ending, there\\u2019s nothing like a bit of jeopardy to keep us watching. So, in a canny reflection of our straitened times, series three of the nation\\u2019s best-loved costume drama began with the revelation that the Crawleys had lost nearly all of their fortune, thanks to an ill-judged investment in the Canadian railways.  In fact, so keen was Fellowes to ensure that Downton Abbey had contemporary relevance that he also had Hugh Bonneville\\u2019s Earl of Grantham utter the words: \\u201CI don\\u2019t want to be the earl who dropped the torch and let the flame go out.\\u201D For one agonising moment, it looked as if Bonneville was going to break the fourth wall and give a knowing wink to the camera. Especially since Bonneville was also the star of the BBC\\u2019s spoof Olympics comedy, Twenty Twelve.  This felt like a programme back to its best, the one we fell in love with back in 2010. The script was tight; the detail was there.Fellowes\\u2019s gift then and now has been to assemble a large and varied cast of characters and make them interrelate in a plausible fashion, which is where the BBC rival Upstairs Downstairs \\u2014 with its pared-down household, all of whom stared at one another as if they were strangers \\u2014 so obviously failed.  And then there was the addition of Hollywood glamour. Shirley MacLaine\\u2019s much-anticipated entrance as Cora\\u2019s mother, Martha, was a masterclass in how to command an audience. \\n\\t\\t\\tRelated Articles\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    Downton Abbey, ITV1, review\\n                \\n\\n\\t23 Sep 2012\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    Brits Damian Lewis, Maggie Smith win at Emmys\\n                \\n\\n\\t24 Sep 2012\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    Emmys 2012: a bad night for the BBC\\n                \\n\\n\\t24 Sep 2012\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    Emmys: Modern Family is a predictable win\\n                \\n\\n\\t24 Sep 2012\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    Downton Abbey, ITV1, review\\n                \\n\\n\\t30 Sep 2012\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    Downton Abbey, ITV1, review\\n                \\n\\n\\t07 Oct 2012\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t As she swished grandly out of her automobile onto the Downton drive, the cast looked quite terrified of her; maybe they were acting (Martha was pretty scary), or maybe they were simply in awe of MacLaine\\u2019s formidable reputation. Anyhow, Martha was a breath of fresh Transatlantic air; and humorously shrewd about the ways of the English.  \\u201CIt\\u2019s so strange to think of the English embracing change,\\u201D she said, moments after her arrival. Maggie Smith\\u2019s Dowager Countess looked as though she had just been offered a mug of luke-warm Bovril.  But, ultimately, tensions are forgiven and forgotten at Downton. Halfway through last night\\u2019s episode, Mary nearly called off the wedding \\u2014 \\u201CHow can you be so disappointing, Matthew?\\u201D \\u2014 but by the end, she was at the altar, and the whole house, both upstairs and downstairs, breathed a sigh of relief.  As she stood beside Matthew, Mary promised him she would be \\u201Cunpredictable\\u201D \\u2014 in a good way. It was a rather sweet moment but hard to imagine: for one of Downton\\u2019s most lovable qualities is that it is predictable. Good will conquer evil, love will conquer hate, and the Dowager Countess will conquer her distaste for vulgar Americans. Well, maybe.

And in a town that already has one show about a precocious young tyke (an indifferently received revival of Annie) on the boards?  The answer, I suspect, is very much yes, as the New York theatre moves into awards-season overdrive in the race for this year\\u2019s Tony Awards.  Britain is usually responsible for producing plenty of Tony contenders, but not this year, where the Best Play nominees are likely to be a fully American quartet.  That means, in turn, that 10-year-old Milly Shapiro (the one of four Matildas performing in this Broadway production I saw) has a lot riding on her slight shoulders. And yet, as Roald Dahl\\u2019s diminutive character would be the first to make clear, mess with this little girl at your peril.  As directed by Matthew Warchus, Matilda has always been the little show that could. Since its Stratford-upon-Avon launch late in 2010, it has stolen the thunder of any number of higher-profile competitors in the West End and now, just possibly, it might do so abroad. The advance sale at Broadway\\u2019s Sam S Shubert Theatre has been pegged near the \\u00A39 million mark \\u2014 far more than its original advance in London, where ticket prices and production costs are, of course, far lower.

At the same time, Bertie Carvel, making his Broadway debut, seems to have adjusted his award-winning termagant of a Trunchbull up a notch, his arm-flapping intensity lending the English actor the feel of a breast-plated whirligig.  But the tremendous heart and intelligence of the piece remains undimmed, and among the new recruits, special kudos must go to Gabriel Ebert\\u2019s Mr Wormwood: a lanky, sartorially challenged spiv with a knockout voice. And at the show\\u2019s capacious heart, one can only thrill to the tiny yet mightily determined Shapiro as she takes the audience on Matilda\\u2019s journey from a surrounding loutishness and neglect through to a world of learning, literature and, by the final curtain, love.

I have spent years going to noisy gigs but nothing was as ear-meltingly painful as the squawking the Beliebers made for their idol. How much more terrifying would the hormonal war cry be in the presence of five times as much teen dream?  Thankfully, my ears survived. Prompted by the band to scream whenever proceedings needed a lift, the audience did at times sound as if 20,000 hungry seagulls had crashed through the dome of the O2. But just as the X Factor boy band are a little older and more Britishly laid back than Bieber, so their fans proved to be less hysterical cult followers and more giggly girls-next-door at a giant pyjama party.  Charm, cheekiness and a smattering of chantalong hits have propelled Simon Cowell\\u2019s prot\\u00E9g\\u00E9s extraordinarily fast to a global arena tour, often packing in two shows a day. The X Factor has proved it can pick out likeable stars, but the truncated TV format fails badly to teach stagecraft. One Direction may pride themselves on being the boyband who don\\u2019t do the cheesy dance routines, but over two hours, with their unexceptional voices and a stodgy section of ballads, what the lads were in dire need of was some kind of showmanship.  They casually strolled, they jumped up and down, and at the chorus they lunged and crunched with some defiant arm-chopping. While Bieber was provocatively dangled like shark bait in a cage over the grabbing hands of his audience, One Direction floated over theirs in an open swing with the look of window cleaners on a night out. As their lyrics demonstrate, like most young men the five-piece have got sex on the brain, but without much in the way of physical display the evening had the dangerous allure of an episode of Glee.

It is the first musical that Kevin Spacey has staged at the august establishment since he took charge of it almost a decade ago.  It was hard not to detect just the mildest hint of disdain upon Sir John Gielgud\\u2019s patrician features as I walked past his photograph on the staircase. Laurence Olivier, at least, would have been enthusiastic: anything goes, the actor-manager riposted when some of the grander elements of his profession asked him if he felt it was prudent for his National Theatre to cheapen itself with a production of Guys and Dolls.  Seven years ago, when I was appointed as this newspaper\\u2019s theatre critic, I was told I had got the job because I had been deemed to be the one applicant who was unlikely to \\u201Cgo native\\u201D in theatreland. And so it worries me a bit that, after initially taking a rather snobby line on musicals, I have in recent years allowed myself to be won over by so many.  I am afraid I\\u2019m now going to have to own up, too, to being seduced by Kiss Me, Kate. This one has the advantage, however, of an intelligent plot, which could reasonably be described as the template for Michael Frayn\\u2019s over-rated Noises Off: it focuses on the on- and off-stage dramas involved in the making of an all-singing, all-dancing production of The Taming of the Shrew.

Miss Waddingham undoubtedly has the most fun, however, with a wickedly bitter rendition of I Hate Men.

Yet for much of its length the play is wonderfully funny \\u2013 though it proved a little too farcical on opening night.  Just as the piece was reaching its pivotal point, in which the boozy Irish craic starts turning into something darker, the tenement door got jammed as a character was about to make her crucial entrance to mourn the death of her son in the war between the Free-Staters and the Republican \\u201CDie Hards\\u201D.  The knock came but the door refused to budge. Improvising wildly, Ciaran Hinds in the role of the feckless, workshy, hard-drinking Captain Boyle asked if anyone had a key. In contrast, Sinead Cusack, playing his long-suffering wife, gave the stout door a good kick. But it remained resolutely stuck. The stage manager came on to announce that the performance would have to stop while the problem was fixed, the curtains were closed and three minutes later the action resumed to audience cheers and applause.  This was unfortunate as poor Bernadette McKenna in the role of the bereaved mother then had to deliver her crucial speech in which she begs \\u201CThe Sacred Heart of the Crucified Jesus\\u201D to \\u201Ctake away our hearts o\\u2019stone and give us hearts o\\u2019flesh\\u2026 Take away this murdherin\\u2019', 'correct', 'hate \\u2026 an\\u2019 give us Thine own eternal love!\\u201D \\n\\t\\t\\tRelated Articles\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    Three Days In May, Trafalgar Studios\\n                \\n\\n\\t03 Nov 2011\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    Stalin almost stole my soul\\n                \\n\\n\\t15 Nov 2011\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    \'The world we\\u2019re presenting is not pretty\'\\n                \\n\\n\\t14 Nov 2011\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t It is to the credit of both actress and audience that the mood of farcical jollity quickly gave way to rapt attention.  But the problematic door seemed symptomatic of a staging that while good in parts, never quite achieves the seamless flow of mood from wild comedy to deepest tragedy. Almost all the performances in Howard Davies\\u2019s production, a joint venture between the NT and Dublin\\u2019s Abbey Theatre are a little too over-emphatic, with characters talking too loudly and often missing the eloquent Irish street poetry of O\\u2019Casey\\u2019s writing and his amazing ability to turn the mood on a sixpence.  Nevertheless there is much to admire. As the strutting puffed up peacock of the title, who calls himself Captain Boyle because he once sailed on a coal ship from Ireland to Liverpool, Hinds finds a rich vein of comedy as this boozy self-aggrandising waster. When he believes he has come into a small fortune, his grandiosity is hilariously caught as the spectacularly decayed tenement apartment is filled with expensive new furniture and he patronises his friends and neighbours like a Lord of the Manor.  Risteard Cooper plays his sponging fair-weather friend Joxer with a mixture of feigned bonhomie and an underlying weasel-like viciousness that is horribly persuasive, while Sinead Cusack discovers a deeply moving tragic depth as all the family\\u2019s frail hopes come crashing down.  The play\\u2019s final minutes, in which death and disgrace suddenly give way to a scene of lurching drunkenness that is as bleakly comic as anything in Beckett are superbly achieved. And when the show settles down, and the door functions properly, this patchy production of a masterpiece might just become a great one. \\n"@en', 'https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-reviews/8894749/Juno-and-the-Paycock-National-Theatre-review.html')

Shirley MacLaine\\u2019s much-anticipated entrance as Cora\\u2019s mother, Martha, was a masterclass in how to command an audience. \\n\\t\\t\\tRelated Articles\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    Downton Abbey, ITV1, review\\n                \\n\\n\\t23 Sep 2012\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    Brits Damian Lewis, Maggie Smith win at Emmys\\n                \\n\\n\\t24 Sep 2012\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    Emmys 2012: a bad night for the BBC\\n                \\n\\n\\t24 Sep 2012\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    Emmys: Modern Family is a predictable win\\n                \\n\\n\\t24 Sep 2012\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    Downton Abbey, ITV1, review\\n                \\n\\n\\t30 Sep 2012\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    Downton Abbey, ITV1, review\\n                \\n\\n\\t07 Oct 2012\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t As she swished grandly out of her automobile onto the Downton drive, the cast looked quite terrified of her; maybe they were acting (Martha was pretty scary), or maybe they were simply in awe of MacLaine\\u2019s formidable reputation. Anyhow, Martha was a breath of fresh Transatlantic air; and humorously shrewd about the ways of the English.  \\u201CIt\\u2019s so strange to think of the English embracing change,\\u201D she said, moments after her arrival. Maggie Smith\\u2019s Dowager Countess looked as though she had just been offered a mug of luke-warm Bovril.  But, ultimately, tensions are forgiven and forgotten at Downton. Halfway through last night\\u2019s episode, Mary nearly called off the wedding \\u2014 \\u201CHow can you be so disappointing, Matthew?\\u201D \\u2014 but by the end, she was at the altar, and the whole house, both upstairs and downstairs, breathed a sigh of relief.  As she stood beside Matthew, Mary promised him she would be \\u201Cunpredictable\\u201D \\u2014 in a good way. It was a rather sweet moment but hard to imagine: for one of Downton\\u2019s most lovable qualities is that it is predictable. Good will conquer evil, love will conquer hate, and the Dowager Countess will conquer her distaste for vulgar Americans. Well, maybe.

But the point is you\'re here.\\" And now that Molly is in \\"the room where it happens,\\" how will she stay in the room?\\u00A0 Comedians often talk about \\"tough crowds,\\" audiences who are begrudging with their laughter. Well, comedians are the toughest crowd of all. \\"Late Night,\\" directed by Nisha Ganatra (whose television credits are lengthy, including Kaling\'s The Mindy Project) is a feel-good movie - in the best sense - with subversive commentary woven into it, so subtly at times you might miss some of it. \\"Late Night\\" has a lot to say, not just about \\"diversity\\" as represented by Kaling walking into a writer\'s room of all white males, but also diversity in terms of class, gender, and age. Kaling was first hired as a writer on NBC\'s \\"The Office\\" through a diversity initiative, after getting a lot of attention for \\"Matt & Ben,\\" the off-Broadway play she co-wrote with Brenda Withers, where Kaling played - hilariously - Ben Affleck. \\"Late Night\\" comes directly from Kaling\'s own experiences. This is an earnest and funny comedy, with very sharp teeth.\\u00A0\\n\\n  Advertisement\\n  \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n            googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\'div-gpt-ad-block-atf-inline\'); });\\n          \\n        \\n  \\n\\n\\n Late-night TV is, notoriously, male-dominated, but in \\"Late Night\\" Kaling imagines a world where the King of Late Night is actually a Queen. (This choice has real satirical bite.) Newbury has been hosting Tonight for 30 years. Her office is lined with her Emmy Awards. She has refused to compromise her standards (as she sees it), and has rejected social media, memes, viral videos, etc. She\'s British, so accusations of her being an \\"elitist\\" don\'t bother her in the slightest. But her ratings going into a nosedive ... that does bother her. Katherine\'s writing staff is made up of men. She has never gotten to know them, and many of them have never even met her. The president of the network (Amy Ryan) wants to replace Katherine with a Dane-Cook-type (Ike Barinholtz), whose \\"provocative\\" routines might give the show some juice. In a panic, Katherine - known for not liking women - orders her right-hand man Brad (Denis O\\u2019Hare) to hire a woman, stat. It\'s the most brazen \\"tokenism\\" you can imagine. Molly Patel just happens to be interviewing with Brad on that very same day. She has no experience, but you can see Brad considering the optics, ticking off the boxes: she\'s a woman, and she\'s a woman of color. She\'s hired.\\u00A0 When Molly walks into that writer\'s room, nobody wants her there. There isn\'t even a chair for her, and she has to sit on an overturned trash can. Reid Scott plays Tom, who keeps reminding everyone that he writes Katherine\'s monologues. Tom is a \\"legacy hire,\\" and yet he feels superior to Molly\'s status as a \\"diversity hire.\\" In his mind, it\'s different. The only guy who is somewhat open to Molly is Charlie (Hugh Dancy), but turns out he\'s a Ladies Man, he\'s got conquest on his mind. Kaling has made some interesting choices in how she has positioned Molly. Molly is not out there working comedy clubs, performing with improv groups, engaged in the hustle. Before getting the writing job, Molly worked Quality Control in a \\"chemical plant\\" (she corrects people who call it a \\"factory\\"), entertaining the workers on the floor with an ongoing \\"comedy routine\\" over the loudspeaker. She is truly an outsider. This gives Kaling a lot of room, since Molly is naive enough to be starry-eyed about the opportunity she\'s been given. She doesn\'t know any better. She shows up for her first day of work bearing cupcakes. One of her mantras is Yeats\' Cloths of Heaven, which she chants as she walks towards the office:\\u00A0 But I, being poor, have only my dreams;I have spread my dreams under your feet;Tread softly because you tread on my dreams. Molly brings her Quality Control experience to bear, suggesting ways to make the show better (ingratiating herself with no one). Kaling knows this territory very well, the lack of diversity in writers\' rooms, plus the overall boys\' club mentality of comedy in general. The pioneering Joan Rivers talked and wrote about it for years. (Rivers remembered being onstage at Second City in the middle of a group improv, and when she stepped into a scene in progress, all the guys held out their arms at her, like, \\"Stay back. We don\'t want you in this scene.\\") Despite the toxicity of much of this, Kaling\'s approach is light-hearted, and she\'s got a great sense of the absurd. There are no villains. Even the guys who clearly don\'t want her there are just beneficiaries of a system set up long before they came around. Amy Ryan\'s character at first seems like a witch on high heels, but she\'s not', 'i>wrong</i', 'about Katherine being out of touch and arrogant. Something has got to change.\\u00A0  \\n    Advertisement\\n    \\n          \\n          \\n            \\n              googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\\"div-gpt-ad-block-btf-inline\\"); });\\n            \\n          \\n    \\n  \\n\\n This is some of Emma Thompson\'s best work (and that\'s saying something). There\'s a truly subversive sequence where Newbury gets embroiled in her own #MeToo moment, calling into question many assumptions about men, women, and power. What\'s subversive about it is how it shows the complexities behind the scenes, the pain, the human frailty, but how does one even address these complexities in such a savage \\"off with her head\\" atmosphere? Kaling addresses it. It\'s very bold. Katherine\'s husband (John Lithgow) is kindly and indulgent, and suffering from a debilitating disease. There\'s always more going on than meets the eye. As Molly gets sucked into the rhythms of her job, it gives Kaling an opportunity to critique how things work, but also - in some of the smartest sequences - examine why jokes work, what makes a joke go viral, the subtleties of comedy itself.\\u00A0 On one level, \\"Late Night\\" has no surprises. Everything happens as you would expect, and right on schedule. But on a deeper satirical level, the level where the movie really works, it\'s one surprise after another. Watch how Molly\'s \\"romance\\" with Charlie is handled. A more conventional movie would have prioritized it in a much different way, giving it more weight than it deserves. Charlie is beautifully in proportion. The movie is not about him. Watch how the dynamic between Molly and Tom develops. It happens almost via stealth, and so the payoff - when it comes - is much more satisfying than it might be otherwise. And mostly, the relationship between Molly and Katherine, growing in fits and starts in scene after scene with Kaling and Thompson - shows two women, struggling to find a handhold in a culture that doesn\'t want them, struggling - at first separately, and then together, to stay \\"in the room where it happens.\\" At Indie Memphis last year, Senior Programmer (and now Artistic Director) Miriam Bale made a speech where she spoke about why the festival was so unique, what made it so special. Bale said, memorably, \\u201CWhen there\\u2019s enough diversity, you don\\u2019t have to worry about diversity. You can focus on art!\\u201D In its own way, \\"Late Night\\" shows how that process can occur. It\'s not easy. You may have to sit on a couple of overturned trash cans in the process. But everybody benefits when more voices are heard.\\n\\n"@en', 'https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/late-night-2019')

The newly christened Snoop Lion appeared on HBO\'s \\"Real Time With Bill Maher\\" a few weeks ago, and throughout his segment, Maher kept smelling his guest. You can bet your last money that Snoop didn\'t smell like April Fresh Downy.Somewhere between inhales, Maher told Snoop \\"you smoke too much weed in this movie!\\"  Snoop agreed, and boy, he was not kidding. If the MPAA were remotely creative, their rating description for \\"Reincarnated\\" would be \\"Rated R for rampant reefer, pervasive pot, some shizznit and constant kutchie passing.\\" This is the first movie that would benefit from being released in Smell-O-Vision.\\u00A0\\n\\n  Advertisement\\n  \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n            googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\'div-gpt-ad-block-atf-inline\'); });\\n          \\n        \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\"Reincarnated\\" has a built-in audience, most of whom will watch it while partaking in Snoop\'s favorite lung filler. They will find much to enjoy here, 80 percent of which will be due to the fact they\'re high as hell. But if you\'re a sober fan of Snoop Dogg\'s rap songs, as I am, you\'re in trouble. \\"Reincarnated\\" comes not to praise Snoop Doggy Dogg but to bury him, documenting Calvin Broadus\' tossing of the Snoop Dogg moniker and the rap career that came with it.After deciding he wants to make a reggae album full of positive messages, Snoop travels to Kingston, Jamaica, to immerse himself in Rastafarian culture. While exploring places like Trench Town, where Bob Marley and his cohorts grew up, Snoop talks about his early years in Long Beach, Calif., and how his environment produced \\"Murder Was The Case,\\" while Marley\'s beget \\"Concrete Jungle.\\" The goal of Snoop Lion is to offset Snoop Dogg\'s \\"negative rap\\" with \\"positive reggae.\\"\\u00A0In an early scene, Snoop meets with reggae legend Bunny Wailer, one of the original members of Bob Marley\'s group. Wailer smokes with Snoop and rechristens him \\"Snoop Lion.\\" The lion is a powerful, respected symbol, and the dog is not. This is a compliment of the highest order, so it becomes a permanent moniker. Snoop asks Wailer to sing on his album, and when Wailer does, his excellent singing contrasts strongly with Snoop\'s attempts.It\'s not that Snoop is a terrible singer; there\'s a great moment in the film where he does a nicely sung impromptu jam with some awestruck kid musicians laying down a wicked, live reggae groove. It\'s just the snippets of the vocals he presents are overprocessed with Auto-Tune and other aggravating holdover devices from rap. Wailer\'s vocal is free of these tricks, and more powerful for it.\\u00A0To create the \\"Reincarnated\\" album, Snoop hires producer Diplo and songwriter Angela Hunte. He meets reggae singer Cutty Corn on the block where Peter Tosh used to live, and when Corn sings him an original composition, Snoop asks if he can record the song with him. Corn brings the \\"struggle part\\" to the \\"Reincarnated\\" album\'s mission statement of \\"songs of peace, love and the struggle.\\"  Snoop also records with his own daughter, who sings a catchy hook that he wrote for her. (Thankfully, she\'s not T-Pained into oblivion by the producers.) Songs like \\"No Guns Allowed\\" deliver Snoop Lion\'s new message, and while \\"Reincarnated\\" includes recording session scenes, we\'re deprived of full versions of any of the songs.\\u00A0  \\n    Advertisement\\n    \\n          \\n          \\n            \\n              googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\\"div-gpt-ad-block-btf-inline\\"); });\\n            </script>\\n          </div>\\n    </div>\\n ', '/article>\\n\\n<p><span style=\\"line-height: 1.45em;\\">As expected from his rap output, Snoop is a good storyteller with a spoken voice I never tire of hearing. To compare and contrast the Snoop Lion persona, he talks about his previous life as \\"Snoop Dogg.\\" This life included robbery, gangs, gunfire, murder trials and the funeral of friend and singer of numerous rap hooks, Nate Dogg. Nate Dogg died of a stroke way too early at 41, and as a fan, I was moved by Snoop\'s account of their friendship and collaboration. Snoop also speaks of his upbringing and his time at Death Row Records. Death Row\'s founder, Suge Knight, gets mentioned doing something nobody else had ever done in the L.A. area, and no, it\'s not an act of violence.\\u00A0</span></p><p><span style=\\"line-height: 1.45em;\\">\\"Reincarnated\\" shines when it focuses on comparisons between the birthplaces of the two sides of Calvin Broadus. The kids who play instruments for Snoop Lion are from a school for troubled boys run by Sister Shirley Chung. As rewards for good behavior, the boys are taught to play musical instruments. \\"Had something like this been in Long Beach,\\" Snoop tells Sister Shirley, \\"I would have been here instead of the street.\\"</span></p><p><span style=\\"line-height: 1.45em;\\">Another scene compares the block Peter Tosh and Bob Marley lived on with Snoop\'s old \'hood. Both blocks\' residents are intensely proud of their location, and Snoop tells the Jamaican residents he understands the concept of neighborhood pride. When someone from another block confronts Snoop regarding a perceived disrespect, Snoop quickly and easily deflates the situation. Things might not have been so quick and easy in Long Beach.\\u00A0</span></p><p><span style=\\"line-height: 1.45em;\\">Unfortunately, these moments of reflection and comparison are few. \\"Reincarnated\\" seems more interested in showing us countless scenes of people smoking herb than in giving us details about the making of the album it purports to be documenting. Granted, Snoop is immersing himself in a culture where this is a customary process, but it gets old and tired very quickly. A ceremony scene involving the Rastafarian equivalent of baptism fascinated me, but \\"Reincarnated\\" neither explains it nor shows it in full. In the ritual, Snoop is officially christened and renamed \\"the light.\\"\\u00A0</span></p', ' <article class=\\"ad\\">\\n    <header><p>Advertisement</p></header>\\n    <div id=\\"ad-review-bottom\\" class=\\"ad-wrapper\\">\\n          <!-- /29848019/ROS_INL_MR_2 -->\\n          <div id=\\"div-gpt-ad-block-btf-inject1\\" style=\'height:250px; width:300px;\'>\\n            <script>\\n              googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\\"div-gpt-ad-block-btf-inject1\\"); });\\n            \\n          \\n    \\n  \\n\\nI saw this film at the Toronto Film Festival, and after the 20,000th shot of somebody leisurely toking, I thought to myself, \\"I could have seen this for free at my \'boy\'s house in Jersey City.

Some he has acted in, some he has not. He has gotten the kind of attention young artists dream about, some good, some bad, festival awards, critical raves and critical derision. As an actor, Dolan has a blank and beautiful quality reminiscent of the young Alain Delon, whose almost otherworldly good looks were show-stopping and yet somehow off-putting as well (utilized to great effect in Jean-Paul Melville\'s \\"Le Samoura\\u00EF\\"). Audiences are drawn to such cinematic beauty, but can also be envious, and slightly hostile. (Alfred Hitchcock loved to fill his films with beautiful people and then make horrible things happen to them.) Is there anything there behind that mask of pure beauty?\\u00A0Dolan\'s latest, \\"Tom at the Farm\\" was completed several years ago (before last year\'s \\"Mommy\\") and is the first time he has adapted an extant work for the screen. Based on a play written by Michel Marc Bouchard (and Bouchard wrote the adaptation with Dolan), the adaptation appears to adhere closely to the original (I have not seen the play), with only a couple of scenes where the action is \\"opened up.\\" (Those scenes, on the whole, are not successful.) \\"Tom at the Farm\\" strains to be a psychological thriller but its length (102 minutes) dissipates the tension that should be taut and compressed. This is Dolan\'s first attempt at genre, and while there is much to admire here (mainly the visuals and the score, both stunning), Dolan\'s interests lie in the strange undercurrents of sado-masochism between the two main characters, and it\'s a through-line that deserves more attention. That through-line could have carried the entire movie if Dolan had let go of being faithful to the original.\\u00A0Tom (Dolan) drives through serene and brightly-colored autumn fields to attend the funeral of his boyfriend Guillaume. Once he arrives and meets Guillaume\'s mother Agathe (Lise Roy, who gives the best performance in the film), he learns that his boyfriend was closeted to his mother and had lied that he had a girlfriend. Tom is a greasy-haired boy, dressed in black leather and huge black boots, clomping through the immaculate farmhouse and the rural surrounding environment, a slash of black against the yellow dying corn. Agathe is eager to meet someone who knew her son, but confused and hurt that the never-met girlfriend did not attend the funeral.\\u00A0The emotional pressure in that farmhouse is so extreme that Tom is roped into going along with his dead boyfriend\'s lie. Tom closets himself, in other words. He decides not to read the shaky eulogy he is seen writing in the first image of the film. It\'s an uneasy choice for him to make. More problems arise when Francis (Pierre-Yves Cardinal), Guillaumes\'s swaggering older brother, who still lives at home with his mother, struts into the kitchen bare-chested, seething with hostility towards the blonde urban interloper. Francis knew his brother\'s secret life, has homophobic contempt for it, and has banned all of the gay friends from coming to the funeral (there\'s a confrontation with one of them at the back of the church). Francis is so intimidating, so awful really, that it\'s strange that Tom doesn\'t just leave immediately after the funeral. But the farm exerts a pull on Tom (the real story of the film). Tom is hypnotized into the dysfunctional workings of the family, their subverted energies working on him like a drug. He can\'t seem to leave. The only time he shows rage and frustration is when he is alone in his car after the funeral. Agathe becomes increasingly frayed. Francis picks fights with Tom, one particularly horrible one in the cornfield, with Tom getting torn to shreds by the razor-sharp dead corn stalks. In one terrible moment, Francis spits into Tom\'s open mouth. But one day, Francis teaches Tom how to milk cows. Then another day, Tom helps birth a calf, and cries with emotion afterwards. Francis reveals that he used to take dance classes, and in one haunting scene, Francis and Tom ballroom dance through the empty barn, Francis dipping Tom back gallantly, the scene moving to romantic slo-mo.\\u00A0What Dolan appears to be going for is a portrait of what could be seen as Stockholm Syndrome or perhaps the beginnings of a possible folie \\u00E0 deux\\u00A0situation. Francis and Tom hate each other, want to be each other, role-reverse, flirt, lash out. Tom is relatively submissive to Francis, taking the beatings, even encouraging them, and Francis senses that, takes pleasure in it. There\'s a sexual dance going on throughout, reminiscent of the murdering duo Leopold and Loeb (especially in the portrayal of the characters in 1959\'s \\"Compulsion\\", highlighting the hypnotic cult-like Master-Slave dynamic), or the novels of Patricia Highsmith, filled with doubling isolated characters. Francis won\'t let Tom leave, throwing obstacles in his way. Tom\'s cell phone doesn\'t work. He doesn\'t just walk down to the main road and hitch a ride. He stays. Francis has no friends, Francis hates gay people, swaggers like a rooster, glories in his singularity. But Tom\'s beautiful blank face before him is dying\\u00A0to be punched, or kissed, or marked in some way. These are the best sections of the film. It\'s really the story, and Dolan\'s intense interest in them is clear in the lingering way these scenes are shot.But as the film continues on and on (it\'s way too long), and Sarah (Evelyne Brochu), a city friend of Tom\'s shows up, pretending to be the girlfriend in order to put Agathe\'s mind at ease, \\"Tom at the Farm\\" unravels. There\'s not enough structure to these different threads. It could work on the stage where movement and place and time are necessarily compressed, but on film it feels artificial, not fully worked out.\\u00A0Beautiful visuals abound throughout (Andr\\u00E9 Turpin, who also shot \\"Mommy\\", is the cinematographer), and there\'s a moody high-contrast look to the landscape (bright trees and bright corn behind dark shadows and fog) that speaks of secrets, torment, hope. The lush and heavy-on-the-strings score of Gabriel Yared is a clue to what Dolan was after. The score punctuates all of the scenes, casual or intense, adding portentous emotion, tension, fear of what is coming. It\'s a melodramatic score, and \\"Tom at the Farm\\" works when it is a family melodrama. These are out-there people with outrageous emotional lives, subsisting on lies and denial, and the abyss between what they think their lives are and what their lives', 'i>really</i', 'are is enormous. All of them choose denial. They get tied to one another by their shared lies, and their unspoken agreement to keep on lying. The score supports that uneasy and terrible energy. The visuals, like the score, are exaggerated and stylistic, starting off with the helicopter shot following Tom\'s car into the countryside, making him seem dwarfed by the surrounding land, a tiny figure entering an unknown isolated world. It\'s a nod to Hitchcock or Kubrick.\\u00A0The thriller elements, the chase scenes, the reveal of horrifying secrets, feel like add-ons, clumsily done and unmotivated, especially when compared to the dark and deep dance (metaphorical and literal) of violence and sex going on between Tom and Francis. That\'s the real juice and guts of the film. It could be an answer to the nagging question throughout: Why the hell doesn\'t Tom just leave? In thrillers, people are always making ridiculous choices that go against their self-interest, or ignoring the red flags in front of them of potential predators. In a well-done thriller, you mostly forgive the unreal quality of these moments. But \\"Tom at the Farm\\" does not foreground the thriller aspect enough (although the score tries mightily to do so), and so Tom doesn\'t seem quite real. Nobody does.\\n\\n  Advertisement\\n  \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n            googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\'div-gpt-ad-block-atf-inline\'); });\\n          \\n        \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n"@en', 'https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/tom-at-the-farm-2015')

The fact that writer/director Analeine Cal y Mayor has created a whimsical little comedy out of a boy who goes through life smelling like fish is one of the main delights of \\"Treading Water.\\" Cal y Mayor takes a light touch, bordering on the surreal. The movie doesn\'t quite hold together at times, and some of the darker elements (like what it feels like to be shamed and shunned at every moment of your life) are soft-pedaled.

Mica\'s parents are played by Ariadna Gil and Don McKellar (\\"Slings and Arrows\\" fans will remember his turn as the ridiculously pretentious guest-director Darren Nichols.) Worried about why their son smells so bad, they take him to a round of doctors and quacks and gurus, who suggest using a specific soap, or who do weird rituals over his head in a candle-lit room. As the child grows, he is bullied at school. He knows he smells so he spends most of his time soaking in the bathtub, sometimes submerging himself completely where he swims around in a dreamy blue world of freedom. By the time Mica is a teenager, his father has abandoned the family, and Mica has isolated himself, spending most of his time at the local pool. He wears an air-freshener around his neck. He talks about his life with his therapist (Carrie Anne Moss). He has a crush on a girl he met at the pool (Zo\\u00EB Kravitz), who remembers him from grade-school. He hesitates to pursue her. Because he smells.\\u00A0Yes, it is all a bit silly, and the silliness is underlined by the house in which Mica and his mother live. It is the home of a famous Mexican singer named Guillermo Garibai (Gonzalo Vega), turned into a museum. Mica\'s mother gives tours. The walls are covered with kitschy portraits of Garibai and framed gold records, and the decor has not been updated since Garibai lived there in the late 1960s and early 1970s. To walk from the living room to the kitchen you have to swerve around all of the velvet ropes. Garibai fans show up at the door in small groups, dressed to the nines, sporting beehive hairdos and colorful dresses. If you\'ve visited Graceland, you know the type. Garabai was their hero, their heartthrob, and they Ooh and Aah over every \\"relic\\" saved in the house, even a broken cologne bottle, preserved under glass. Mica grows up with people wandering randomly through his bedroom (\\"and this is the room where Garibai was inspired to write his most famous song\\"), interrupting his bath time. Elisa Sauve was the production designer and the set of that house is such a weird and loopy environment that it automatically signals that none of this should be taken <i>too</i> seriously. Yes, the poor boy smells like fish and he has no friends, and yes, all of these bad things happen to his mother and father, but get a load of that house! Cal y Mayor', 'i>milks</i', 'that set. She finds every bit of humor possible in having her lead character live in an environment devoted to the idolization of the Mexican Elvis whose hey-day was 40 years before.Mica and Laura\'s romance is tentative. Both of them are keeping secrets from the other. But nothing is too intense. The romance is not the greatest love of all time, and Mica is more of a passive recipient of events rather than an active participant, a problem with the performance. His stakes always seem pretty low. He has accepted his lot in life. He smells like fish. There is no cure. Mica continues to swirl around underneath the water in the pool, freed up from the dry-day world that recoils from him.

These sessions beget \\u201CHitchcock/Truffaut,\\u201D a book whose raison d\'\\u00EAtre was to show American critics that they were underestimating the cinematic richness of Hitchcock\\u2019s work. At the time, Hitchcock had been deemed a director of entertaining movies, lacking substance and importance. Despite his fifth directing Oscar nod for \\u201CPsycho,\\u201D Hitchcock was mainly seen as a director for the unwashed masses of general audiences. Truffaut aimed to fix that, and the resulting book is a master class in the fine art of directing, filled with photographs and the Master of Suspense\\u2019s candid observations of his oeuvre. Since its first edition published in 1966, \\u201CHitchcock/Truffaut\\u201D has been a staple and a fixture of any cinephile\\u2019s bookshelf.\\n\\n  Advertisement\\n  \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n            googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\'div-gpt-ad-block-atf-inline\'); });\\n          \\n        \\n  \\n\\n\\nFast-forward to 2015, where film critic and documentarian Kent Jones brings us the movie version of this essential book. Jones\\u2019 take on \\u201CHitchcock/Truffaut\\u201D is equal parts adaptation, CliffsNotes guide and commentary by a slew of directors influenced by Hitchcock\\u2019s work. The film is also a completely entertaining and informative gift to movie lovers, a work constructed with care, humor and insight. Though Hitchcock made his last movie (\\u201CFamily Plot\\") 40 years ago, he continues to influence in an almost transparent manner. Hitchcock is in the air that today\\u2019s directors breathe, and \\u201CHitchcock/Truffaut\\u201D aims to remind us of this fact.Jones supplements his film clips and interviews with audio from the original 27 hours of interview recordings (17 hours of which are available online). We hear Hitchcock discuss, in directorial terms, movies such as \\u201CSabotage,\\u201D \\u201CVertigo\\u201D and \\u201CThe Lodger.\\u201D We also hear Truffaut describing a scene from \\u201CThe 400 Blows\\u201D as a follow-up to Hitch\\u2019s description of \\u201Csuspense vs. surprise.\\u201D\\u00A0This is one of the most interesting passages in the film, a moment where the interviewer and the subject exchange places, comparing notes as footage of Truffaut\\u2019s film plays onscreen. Throughout \\u201CHitchcock/Truffaut,\\u201D one gets the feeling that the visual nature of directing forces a filmmaker to deal with his or her obsessions, explicitly or implicitly.\\u201CIf you think you can hide your prurient interests as a director, you\\u2019re crazy,\\u201D says David Fincher, one of several directors testifying before the camera. Fincher marvels at how blatantly Hitchcock expressed his own psychological traumas and aforementioned interests, several of which revolved around fear and sex. The famous story of how Hitchcock\\u2019s father had him locked up by Scotland Yard as a child is recounted here, and Hitchcock\\u2019s description of Kim Novak\\u2019s famous transformation scene in \\u201CVertigo\\u201D has a frank sexuality that\\u2019s as accurate as it is racy.\\u00A0In James Gray\\u2019s opinion, this scene contains \\u201Cthe greatest shot in the history of cinema.\\u201D  \\n    Advertisement\\n    \\n          \\n          \\n            \\n              googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\\"div-gpt-ad-block-btf-inline\\"); });\\n            </script>\\n          </div>\\n    </div>\\n  </article>\\n\\n<p>\\u201CHitchcock/Truffaut\\u201D spends a fair amount of time on \\u201CVertigo\\u201D, which isn\\u2019t surprising given that film\\u2019s current placement atop the Sight and Sound list. <a href=\\"/cast-and-crew/paul-schrader\\">Paul Schrader</a> calls it \\u201C<i>a forbidden document.</i>\\u201D <a href=\\"/cast-and-crew/martin-scorsese\\">Martin Scorsese</a> discusses how difficult it was to get a copy of the film screened back in the \'60s, as Hitchcock\\u2019s films were looked at with scorn and derision by the art theaters of the day.\\u00A0Since the film was not a success upon first run, Hitchcock sounds a bit reserved when talking about the film; people didn\\u2019t discuss their flops back then. \\u201C<i>You have a problem with it?</i>\\u201D asks Truffaut. Hitchcock responds that he took issue with \\u201C<i>the hole in the story</i>\\u201D regarding the murderer. This is an interesting contrast to his view on the numerous plot holes in hits like \\u201CNorth by Northwest.\\" \\u201C<i>I have this saying,</i>\\u201D he tells Truffaut in regard to those who complain about implausibility: \\u201C<i>Logic is dull.</i>\\u201D</p><p>Throughout \\u201CHitchcock/Truffaut\\u201D, Jones gives us delicious quotes from the interview. \\"\'<i>The Lodger\' is the first movie where I exercised any style,\\"</i>\\u00A0says the man who started out in silent movies when he was 23. Before directing, Hitchcock wrote dialogue titles and used his engineering background to draw and layout scenes. Truffaut suggests that those who started out as silent film directors know something that those who started out in the sound era will never know. The lack of sound forced a purer evocation of the cinema as a visual medium. \\u201C<i>You can watch a Hitchcock movie with the sound off,</i>\\u201D we\\u2019re told, \\u201C<i>and you\\u2019ll still be able to follow it.</i>\\u201D</p><p>This notion extends to the use of the suspense element for which Hitchcock is most known. The visuals transcend the language barrier. \\u201C<i>The Japanese audience should scream at the same time the Indian audience does,</i>\\u201D Hitchcock says. Jones uses a', 'a href=\\"/cast-and-crew/tippi-hedren\\">Tippi Hedren</a> scene from \\u201CThe Birds\\u201D to supplement Hitchcock\\u2019s discussion on how he uses space and an actor\\u2019s place within it to heighten tension, bringing out a particular element that I hadn\\u2019t noticed in the numerous times I\\u2019d seen the film.</p><p>\\u201CHitchcock/Truffaut\\u201D offers a lot of ideas to contemplate and discuss, especially if you\\u2019re a lover of Hitchcock\\u2019s works. Its most intriguing takeaway is a question Hitchcock posed to Truffaut. In so many words, he wonders if he should have experimented more with characters and if he had become \\u201C<i>a prisoner of my own form</i>.\\u201D It\\u2019s a fascinating question, one I carried with me after I left the theater. Wisely, Jones doesn\\u2019t provide any answers, for there isn\\u2019t a definitive one to be had. Instead, he gives us David Fincher\\u2019s quote that \\u201C<i>there was a set of rules, and Hitchcock broke them all.</i>\\u201D</p', ' <article class=\\"ad\\">\\n    <header><p>Advertisement</p></header>\\n    <div id=\\"ad-review-bottom\\" class=\\"ad-wrapper\\">\\n          <!-- /29848019/ROS_INL_MR_2 -->\\n          <div id=\\"div-gpt-ad-block-btf-inject1\\" style=\'height:250px; width:300px;\'>\\n            <script>\\n              googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\\"div-gpt-ad-block-btf-inject1\\"); });\\n            \\n          \\n    \\n  \\n\\nOne interview subject you might be expecting is missing from \\u201CHitchcock/Truffaut.\\" Brian De Palma declined to appear in the film, but he had a good reason.

Haneke, whose academic background is in psychology, philosophy and theater, assumes the role of empirical taskmaster. He hypothesizes that his box will shock you into a knee-jerk ethical dilemma.

See the captors tighten a pillowcase over a young boy\'s head, force Mom to strip (no actual nudity shown) by the TV, smash Dad\'s leg with a golf club and play hide and seek with the body of the family dog they\'ve just killed with the same driver! For the price of a ticket, you can choose the level and nature of your vicarious involvement with the sadism on the screen, and the masochism in your seat. Enjoy.The game\'s narrative parameters are as follows: A dubiously American bourgeois family -- Ann (Naomi Watts), George (Tim Roth), their pre-teen son Georgie (Devon Gearhart) and their golden retriever -- arrive at their vacation home on Long Island. They are upper-class ciphers who stock soy milk in the refrigerator, feed their dog expensive Wellness brand kibble and keep a Tivoli radio in the kitchen. The attention paid to the details of their conspicuous consumption may or may not express the film\'s attitude: that these cardboard caricatures somehow deserve to be humiliated, tormented and killed for exhibiting Eurocentric yuppie tastes, including implicitly sinful predilections for golf, boating and classical music. Or maybe the movie is simply suggesting that you give yourself permission to feel that way.Two symbolic young men, Paul (Michael Pitt) and Peter (Brady Corbett), show up at the screen door, dressed in shorts, canvas shoes, white sweaters and white gloves. They proceed, politely and methodically, to terrorize, torture and murder their hostages, offering a rigged \\"bet,\\" in the guise of \\"entertainment,\\" on behalf of the film: that all family members will be dead by a certain hour. Meanwhile, the victims are bludgeoned into submission and despair. The torturers are blandly passive-aggressive and genteel, their motiveless actions appearing alternately logical and irrational, inexorable and impulsive, cruel and -- even more cruelly -- kind. The movie\'s running time is 1 hour and 52 minutes.  \\n    Advertisement\\n    \\n          \\n          \\n            \\n              googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\\"div-gpt-ad-block-btf-inline\\"); });\\n            \\n          \\n    \\n  \\n\\nEvery once in a while, Paul addresses the camera with a conspiratorial smile or a nudge-nudge, wink-wink joke. He guesses that \\"you [the audience] are probably on their [the victims\'] side.\\" He and Peter represent the film\'s side. What do you want to bet they will win the already-decided bet? As an academic exercise in learned helplessness, the film flaunts the ultimate power to rewrite its own \\"rules\\" whenever it likes, including taking back anything that has already been shown. A movie with no restrictions holds no real suspense, and no surprises, so any revelation of plot details in, say, a review, is meaningless.What makes \\"Funny Games\\" different than any other campy-scary horror movie that gets off on tormenting its characters and teasing its audience? Not much. It\'s being pitched to the \\"Hostel\\" crowd (who are invited to laugh) and the art-house crowd (who are invited to feel ennobled as they shake their heads and lament the state of violence in movies).Haneke (whose masterworks include \\"Code Unknown\\" and \\"Cache\\") explains that his distinctively European film is \\"a reaction to ... the way American cinema toys with human beings ... [so that] violence is made consumable.\\" That\'s true, and it\'s what \\"Funny Games\\" sets out to do, but Haneke\'s essay fails because he hasn\'t a clue about what makes American movies tick. \\"Funny Games\\" doesn\'t seduce you with conventional storytelling and character development and then turn them around on you -- like, say, Alfred Hitchcock\'s \\"Rear Window\\" and \\"Psycho.\\" Instead, as the press kit explains, it encourages its viewers \\"to see their own role through a series of emotional and analytical episodes.\\" In other words, this isn\'t a movie, it\'s a thesis.\\"Funny Games\\" represents the laborious execution of an abstract notion. The concept is the movie, kind of like Andy Warhol\'s \'\'Empire\'\' (1964), an eight-hour stationary shot of the Empire State Building.

The dinosaurs look amazingly real, and we see them plunge into the midst of 360-degree action; a man on a motorcycle even rides between the legs of a running beast. It can be said that the creatures in this film transcend any visible signs of special effects and seem to walk the earth. But the same realism isn\'t brought to the human characters, who are bound by plot conventions and action formulas, and scripted to do stupid things so that they can be chased and sometimes eaten by the dinosaurs.Maybe it was already too late. Perhaps the time to do the thinking on this project was before the first film, when all the possibilities lay before Spielberg. He should have tossed aside the original Michael Crichton novel, knowing it had given him only one thing of use: an explanation for why dinosaurs might walk among us. Everything else--the scientific mumbo-jumbo, the theme park scheme--was just the recycling of other movies. We know the tired old plot lessons already, about man\'s greed and pride, and how it is punished, and why it does not pay to interfere with Mother Nature.Why not a pseudo-documentary in which the routine plot elements are simply ignored, and the characters venture into the unknown and are astonished and frightened by what they find? There are moments in the first \\"Jurassic Park\'\' which capture a genuine sense of wonder, the first time we see the graceful, awesome prehistoric creatures moving in stately calm beyond the trees. But soon they are cut down to size by a plot which has them chasing and scaring the human characters, as in any monster movie.  \\n    Advertisement\\n    \\n          \\n          \\n            \\n              googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\\"div-gpt-ad-block-btf-inline\\"); });\\n            </script>\\n          </div>\\n    </div>\\n ', '/article>\\n\\n<p>\\"The Lost World\'\' is even more perfunctory.

They land on the island, are soon photographing prehistoric creatures, and so careless is the screenplay that the newcomers to the plot are not even allowed to express their amazement the first time they see their prey.</p><p>Much of the film, especially the action scenes, is shot at night in the rain. I assume that\'s to provide better cover for the special effects; we see relatively few dinosaurs in bright light, and the conceit is taken so far that even the press conference announcing a new dinosaur park in San Diego is held in the middle of the night. The night scenes also allow Spielberg to use his most familiar visual trademark, the visible beams from powerful flashlights, but apart from that touch, Spielberg doesn\'t really seem present in the picture: This feels like the kind of sequel a master hands over to an apprentice, and you sense that although much effort was lavished on the special effects, Spielberg\'s interest in the story was perfunctory.</p><p>Here\'s the key to the movie\'s weakness: Many elaborate sequences exist only to be . . . elaborate sequences. In a better movie, they would play a role in the story. Consider the drawn-out episode of the dangling research trailer, for example, which hangs over a cliff while the characters dangle above a terrifying drop and a hero tries to save the trailer from falling, while a dinosaur attacks. This is only what it seems to be, an action sequence. Nothing more. It doesn\'t lead into or out of anything, and is not necessary, except to fill screen time. It plays like an admission that the filmmakers couldn\'t think of something more intriguing involving the real story line.</p', ' <article class=\\"ad\\">\\n    <header><p>Advertisement</p></header>\\n    <div id=\\"ad-review-bottom\\" class=\\"ad-wrapper\\">\\n          <!-- /29848019/ROS_INL_MR_2 -->\\n          <div id=\\"div-gpt-ad-block-btf-inject1\\" style=\'height:250px; width:300px;\'>\\n            <script>\\n              googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\\"div-gpt-ad-block-btf-inject1\\"); });\\n            \\n          \\n    \\n  \\n\\nConsider, too, the character of Goldblum\'s daughter (Vanessa Lee Chester). Why is she here? To be placed in danger, to inspire contrived domestic disagreements, and to make demands so that the plot can get from A to B. At one point, inside the trailer, she gets frightened and says urgently that she \\"wants to go someplace real high--right now! Right now!\'\' So Goldblum and another character put her in a cage that lifts them above the forest, after which Goldblum must descend from the cage, after which I was asking why they had ascended in it in the first place. (Early in the film, it is established that the girl is a gymnast; later the film observes the ancient principle that every gymnast in a movie sooner or later encounters a bar.) There are some moments that work. Pete Postlethwaite, as a big game hunter who flies onto the island with a second wave of dinosaur mercenaries, doesn\'t step wrong; he plays a convincing if shallow character, even if he\'s called upon to make lengthy speeches in speeding Jeeps, and to utter arty lines about \\"movable feasts\'\' and having \\"spent enough time in the company of death.\'\' He alone among the major characters seems convinced that he is on an island with dinosaurs, and not merely in a special-effects movie about them.The film\'s structure is weird. I thought it was over, and then it began again, with a San Diego sequence in which Spielberg seemed to be trying to upstage the upcoming \\"Godzilla\'\' movie. The monster-stepping-on-cars sequences in the current Japanese import \\"Gamera: Guardian of the Universe\'\' are more entertaining. And can we really believe that a ship could ram a pier at full speed and remain seaworthy? The problem with the movie is that the dinosaurs aren\'t allowed to be the stars. They\'re marvelously conceived and executed, but no attempt is made to understand their fearsomeness; much of the plot hinges on mommy and daddy T-rexes exhibiting parental feelings for their offspring. Must we see everything in human terms? At one point, one character tells another, \\"These creatures haven\'t walked the earth for tens of millions of years, and now all you want to do is shoot them?\'\' Somebody could have asked Spielberg the same question.\\n\\n"@en', 'https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-lost-world-jurassic-park-1997')

Some he has acted in, some he has not. He has gotten the kind of attention young artists dream about, some good, some bad, festival awards, critical raves and critical derision. As an actor, Dolan has a blank and beautiful quality reminiscent of the young Alain Delon, whose almost otherworldly good looks were show-stopping and yet somehow off-putting as well (utilized to great effect in Jean-Paul Melville\'s \\"Le Samoura\\u00EF\\"). Audiences are drawn to such cinematic beauty, but can also be envious, and slightly hostile. (Alfred Hitchcock loved to fill his films with beautiful people and then make horrible things happen to them.) Is there anything there behind that mask of pure beauty?\\u00A0Dolan\'s latest, \\"Tom at the Farm\\" was completed several years ago (before last year\'s \\"Mommy\\") and is the first time he has adapted an extant work for the screen. Based on a play written by Michel Marc Bouchard (and Bouchard wrote the adaptation with Dolan), the adaptation appears to adhere closely to the original (I have not seen the play), with only a couple of scenes where the action is \\"opened up.\\" (Those scenes, on the whole, are not successful.) \\"Tom at the Farm\\" strains to be a psychological thriller but its length (102 minutes) dissipates the tension that should be taut and compressed. This is Dolan\'s first attempt at genre, and while there is much to admire here (mainly the visuals and the score, both stunning), Dolan\'s interests lie in the strange undercurrents of sado-masochism between the two main characters, and it\'s a through-line that deserves more attention. That through-line could have carried the entire movie if Dolan had let go of being faithful to the original.\\u00A0Tom (Dolan) drives through serene and brightly-colored autumn fields to attend the funeral of his boyfriend Guillaume. Once he arrives and meets Guillaume\'s mother Agathe (Lise Roy, who gives the best performance in the film), he learns that his boyfriend was closeted to his mother and had lied that he had a girlfriend. Tom is a greasy-haired boy, dressed in black leather and huge black boots, clomping through the immaculate farmhouse and the rural surrounding environment, a slash of black against the yellow dying corn. Agathe is eager to meet someone who knew her son, but confused and hurt that the never-met girlfriend did not attend the funeral.\\u00A0The emotional pressure in that farmhouse is so extreme that Tom is roped into going along with his dead boyfriend\'s lie. Tom closets himself, in other words. He decides not to read the shaky eulogy he is seen writing in the first image of the film. It\'s an uneasy choice for him to make. More problems arise when Francis (Pierre-Yves Cardinal), Guillaumes\'s swaggering older brother, who still lives at home with his mother, struts into the kitchen bare-chested, seething with hostility towards the blonde urban interloper. Francis knew his brother\'s secret life, has homophobic contempt for it, and has banned all of the gay friends from coming to the funeral (there\'s a confrontation with one of them at the back of the church). Francis is so intimidating, so awful really, that it\'s strange that Tom doesn\'t just leave immediately after the funeral. But the farm exerts a pull on Tom (the real story of the film). Tom is hypnotized into the dysfunctional workings of the family, their subverted energies working on him like a drug. He can\'t seem to leave. The only time he shows rage and frustration is when he is alone in his car after the funeral. Agathe becomes increasingly frayed. Francis picks fights with Tom, one particularly horrible one in the cornfield, with Tom getting torn to shreds by the razor-sharp dead corn stalks. In one terrible moment, Francis spits into Tom\'s open mouth. But one day, Francis teaches Tom how to milk cows. Then another day, Tom helps birth a calf, and cries with emotion afterwards. Francis reveals that he used to take dance classes, and in one haunting scene, Francis and Tom ballroom dance through the empty barn, Francis dipping Tom back gallantly, the scene moving to romantic slo-mo.\\u00A0What Dolan appears to be going for is a portrait of what could be seen as Stockholm Syndrome or perhaps the beginnings of a possible folie \\u00E0 deux\\u00A0situation. Francis and Tom hate each other, want to be each other, role-reverse, flirt, lash out. Tom is relatively submissive to Francis, taking the beatings, even encouraging them, and Francis senses that, takes pleasure in it. There\'s a sexual dance going on throughout, reminiscent of the murdering duo Leopold and Loeb (especially in the portrayal of the characters in 1959\'s \\"Compulsion\\", highlighting the hypnotic cult-like Master-Slave dynamic), or the novels of Patricia Highsmith, filled with doubling isolated characters. Francis won\'t let Tom leave, throwing obstacles in his way. Tom\'s cell phone doesn\'t work. He doesn\'t just walk down to the main road and hitch a ride. He stays. Francis has no friends, Francis hates gay people, swaggers like a rooster, glories in his singularity. But Tom\'s beautiful blank face before him is dying\\u00A0to be punched, or kissed, or marked in some way. These are the best sections of the film. It\'s really the story, and Dolan\'s intense interest in them is clear in the lingering way these scenes are shot.But as the film continues on and on (it\'s way too long), and Sarah (Evelyne Brochu), a city friend of Tom\'s shows up, pretending to be the girlfriend in order to put Agathe\'s mind at ease, \\"Tom at the Farm\\" unravels. There\'s not enough structure to these different threads. It could work on the stage where movement and place and time are necessarily compressed, but on film it feels artificial, not fully worked out.\\u00A0Beautiful visuals abound throughout (Andr\\u00E9 Turpin, who also shot \\"Mommy\\", is the cinematographer), and there\'s a moody high-contrast look to the landscape (bright trees and bright corn behind dark shadows and fog) that speaks of secrets, torment, hope. The lush and heavy-on-the-strings score of Gabriel Yared is a clue to what Dolan was after. The score punctuates all of the scenes, casual or intense, adding portentous emotion, tension, fear of what is coming. It\'s a melodramatic score, and \\"Tom at the Farm\\" works when it is a family melodrama. These are out-there people with outrageous emotional lives, subsisting on lies and denial, and the abyss between what they think their lives are and what their lives', 'i>really</i', 'are is enormous. All of them choose denial. They get tied to one another by their shared lies, and their unspoken agreement to keep on lying. The score supports that uneasy and terrible energy. The visuals, like the score, are exaggerated and stylistic, starting off with the helicopter shot following Tom\'s car into the countryside, making him seem dwarfed by the surrounding land, a tiny figure entering an unknown isolated world. It\'s a nod to Hitchcock or Kubrick.\\u00A0The thriller elements, the chase scenes, the reveal of horrifying secrets, feel like add-ons, clumsily done and unmotivated, especially when compared to the dark and deep dance (metaphorical and literal) of violence and sex going on between Tom and Francis. That\'s the real juice and guts of the film. It could be an answer to the nagging question throughout: Why the hell doesn\'t Tom just leave? In thrillers, people are always making ridiculous choices that go against their self-interest, or ignoring the red flags in front of them of potential predators. In a well-done thriller, you mostly forgive the unreal quality of these moments. But \\"Tom at the Farm\\" does not foreground the thriller aspect enough (although the score tries mightily to do so), and so Tom doesn\'t seem quite real. Nobody does.\\n\\n  Advertisement\\n  \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n            googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\'div-gpt-ad-block-atf-inline\'); });\\n          \\n        \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n"@en', 'https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/tom-at-the-farm-2015')

I hadn\'t seen it in years, and remembered mostly the broad outlines, the one-liners, the romance between a middle-aged man and a high school girl. Seeing it again I realize it\'s more subtle, more complex, and not about love, but loss. There are a lot of songs on the soundtrack, but the one that speaks for the hero says \'\'they\'re playing songs of love, but not for me.\'\'\\n\\n  Advertisement\\n  \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n            googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\'div-gpt-ad-block-atf-inline\'); });\\n          \\n        \\n  \\n\\n\\nThe movie\'s May-November romance was criticized because Isaac (Woody Allen) and Tracy (Mariel Hemingway) seem to have so little in common. But she at least has what lovers need, an ability to idealize the other person, and that\'s his fatal lack in the relationship: He doesn\'t feel she\'s special enough, and he doesn\'t see a future for them. Urging her to go to London on a scholarship, he consoles her, \'\'you\'ll think of me as a fond memory.\'\' He spends half of their time together trying to break up, and finally succeeds, taking her to a soda fountain after school--a location with perfect irony, given her age--to tell her he loves another woman, which is not exactly true. \'\'Now I don\'t feel so good,\'\' she says, in one of several lines that Hemingway makes both simple and heartbreaking.Only later, too much later, does Isaac confess to a friend, \'\'I think I really missed a good bet when I let Tracy go.\'\' Well, maybe he did, or maybe he was right and there was no plausible future between a 42-year-old (however immature) and a 17-year-old. The movie isn\'t about that. It\'s about the cynicism and superficiality of the modern mating dance, and how all Isaac\'s glib sophistication can\'t save him from true feelings, when they come.His character is surrounded by other adults who inhabit the wreckage of relationships. Isaac\'s former wife (Meryl Streep) left him to live with a woman, and writes a best seller ridiculing their marriage and love life; we doubt her new relationship is sound if it leaves her so obsessed with the previous one. Yale (Michael Murphy), has been happily married for years, but is having an affair with Mary (Diane Keaton). Both men have the tactic of trying to escape from relationships by telling the woman it\'s for her own good. Allen has Mary tell Yale they have no future, right after Isaac has told Tracy the same thing. Yale even more or less gives Mary to Isaac, to get her off his hands (\'\'You\'d be great for her\'\'), and they have a little fling before Yale realizes he loves her after all.Neither man can deal with affection. Both hide behind words, but are powerless in the face of emotional truth. The movie is not really about love in the present, but love in the past--about the wistful pain when we realize we had a beautiful thing, and screwed it up. In a more conventional movie, Yale and Mary would be the central couple, and Isaac and Tracy would be their best friends; authors since Shakespeare have mirrored their heroic lovers with comedic counterpoints, but Allen\'s whole career is based on making the secondary characters heroic. The relationship of Isaac and Mary is not a romantic comedy, then, but complex and tricky, and unforgiving in the way it sees Isaac running in place because he doesn\'t know whether to run toward Mary or away from her.  \\n    Advertisement\\n    \\n          \\n          \\n            \\n              googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\\"div-gpt-ad-block-btf-inline\\"); });\\n            </script>\\n          </div>\\n    </div>\\n  </article>\\n\\n<p>It is at the same time a breathtaking hymn to the idea of being in love in Manhattan, a place Allen loves. The opening shot is a stunner, looking West across Central Park at dawn while Gershwin\'s \'\'Rhapsody in Blue\'\' does what it always does--makes us feel transcendent. The locations are like an anthology of Manhattan shrines: The characters visit the Guggenheim, Elaine\'s, Zabar\'s deli. They sit on a park bench at dawn beneath a towering bridge, and ride a carriage through Central Park, and row boats in the lagoon. They go to art movies and concerts and eat Chinese food in bed and play racquetball. Allen knows that songs are the soundtracks of our lives, and gives us not only \'\'But Not for Me\'\' but \'\'Sweet and Lowdown,\'\' \'\'I Got a Crush on You,\'\' \'\'Do Do Do,\'\' \'\'Lady Be Good,\'\' \'\'Embraceable You,\'\' \'\'Someone to Watch Over Me\'\' and, when Isaac runs and runs to the girl he finally realizes he loves, \'\'Strike Up the Band.\'\'</p><p>All of these locations and all of these songs would not have the effect they do without the widescreen black and white cinematography of', 'a href=\\"/cast-and-crew/gordon-willis\\">Gordon Willis</a>. This is one of the best-photographed movies ever made, and a compelling argument for letterboxing on home video, since many of the compositions exploit the full width of the screen. Consider, for example, the sweet little conversation Isaac and Tracy have in his apartment, in a pool of light in the lower left corner of the screen, while the empty apartment stretches out toward a spiral staircase on the right: How better to show Tracy bringing life into this vast but lonely home?</p><p>Some of the scenes are famous just because of Willis\' lighting. For example, the way Isaac and Mary walk through the observatory as if they\'re strolling among the stars or on the surface of the moon. Later, as their conversation gets a little lost, Willis daringly lets them disappear into darkness, and then finds them again with just a sliver of side-lighting.</p><p>Keaton, of course, was famous after \\"<a href=\\"/reviews/great-movie-the-godfather-1972\\">The Godfather</a>\\" (1972), but she became a star and won an Oscar in Allen\'s \\"<a href=\\"/reviews/great-movie-annie-hall-1977\\">Annie Hall</a>\\" (1977). \'\'Manhattan,\'\' made two years later, has echoes of Annie in Mary, but they\'re more a case of Keaton\'s personal mannerisms than of a similarity in the characters. Mary is less flighty, less a deliberate eccentric, more a woman who uses her bright intelligence as a shield against loneliness. She\'s too smart to cause trouble and too careless to stay out of it; she tells the married Yale she doesn\'t want him to leave his wife, she doesn\'t want to be a homebreaker, yet she loves him--and she\'s stuck on Sunday afternoons with no one to talk to or play with. \'\'It\'s just bad timing,\'\' she finally says. Her fling with Isaac is really based on their mutual isolation; they don\'t have anyone else to call.</p', ' <article class=\\"ad\\">\\n    <header><p>Advertisement</p></header>\\n    <div id=\\"ad-review-bottom\\" class=\\"ad-wrapper\\">\\n          <!-- /29848019/ROS_INL_MR_2 -->\\n          <div id=\\"div-gpt-ad-block-btf-inject1\\" style=\'height:250px; width:300px;\'>\\n            <script>\\n              googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\\"div-gpt-ad-block-btf-inject1\\"); });\\n            \\n          \\n    \\n  \\n\\nThis was Mariel Hemingway\'s first substantial role, and it won her an Oscar nomination. Like her character, she was just turning 18. Her performance is so direct, so artless, so without affect, that it goes straight to the heart of the matter. And her size plays an interesting role in the movie. She is, of course, taller than Allen, but the meaning of that difference is not as simple as the tall girl-short guy syndrome. Seeing them together on the screen, I was struck by how unconcealable she is, how her presence is such an inescapable fact; in social situations, Isaac tends to take cover, to hide behind his wit, to make guerrilla raids on conversations, and this girl at his side makes him so visible. She attracts enemy fire. Watch Isaac\'s face when Mary asks, \'\'And what do you do, Tracy?\'\' and she replies, \'\'I go to high school.\'\'Woody Allen, it is said, always plays the same character in his movies. This is unfair. He often has the same verbal facility, yes, and some of the same mannerisms, but Isaac here is seen very specifically as a man whose yearnings and insecurities are founded on a deep immaturity. He wants, but doesn\'t know what he wants. He quits his job in an attack of ethics, but has no back-up plan. Look at Allen\'s face in Isaac\'s final scene with Tracy, as he pleads with her to stay with him, to not go to London, even while he realizes he is simply being selfish. A lesser actor would have gone over the top in the pleading, and then overdone the disappointment. Allen finds the difficult, precise tone of a man who desires and regrets and yet actually does like this young woman enough to know she\'s doing the right thing. He had her but he lost her, and now they both know their time has passed. He isn\'t planning the future, but trying to rewrite the past. She\'ll think of him as a fond memory.\\n\\n"@en', 'https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-manhattan-1979')

The script was written by Denne Bart Petitclerc and was based on his own experiences with Ernest Hemingway, whom he befriended as a young journalist. Petitclerc passed away a decade ago, and he would\\u2019ve been thrilled to learn that the long belated project would become the first Hollywood film shot in Cuba since 1959, and that various scenes would be shot in the locations where Hemingway once resided. Even Mariel Hemingway, the writer\\u2019s granddaughter, turns up in an all-too-brief cameo. These behind-the-scenes factoids are the most interesting aspects of the film\\u2014and, regrettably, the only interesting aspects, as well.\\u00A0\\n\\n  Advertisement\\n  \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n            googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\'div-gpt-ad-block-atf-inline\'); });\\n          \\n        \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nLikening \\u201CPapa\\u201D to a made-for-TV movie would be inaccurate, considering how cinematic TV has become in recent years, and how many programs are oftentimes superior to typical theatrical offerings (look no further than this year\\u2019s inaugural season of \\u201CAmerican Crime Story\\u201D for sufficient proof). \\u201CPapa\\u201D is merely cinema at its dullest, a perfunctory assemblage of biographical bullet points in which characters explain their lives rather than live them. Petitclerc\\u2019s fictionalized self is inexplicably renamed Ed Myers and played by Giovanni Ribisi in a performance so wooden, he occasionally resembles the wax dummy of Joseph Cotten. Myers owes his entire career to Hemingway, and has obsessed over crafting the perfect letter to his hero. When his girlfriend, Debbie (Minka Kelly), secretly mails the letter, Hemingway is so impressed with it that he calls Myers and invites him on a fishing trip. The fact that we never see the contents of the letter is a prime example of how the storytelling continuously keeps us at arm\\u2019s length, never allowing us to fully understand the bond that developed between these men.\\u00A0\\nRather than pause for a few beats that would allow Myers and Hemingway to feel each other out during their initial encounter, the film cuts abruptly to a comedic fishing sequence that is punctuated with a punchline delivered by Hemingway. Adrian Sparks does all he can with a role comprised of either wise platitudes or self-destructive outbursts. Take a fleeting glimpse at any given shot of Ribisi and Sparks aboard a boat, and you\\u2019d swear you were looking at Roy Scheider and Robert Shaw in \\u201CJaws\\u201D (albeit without a shark, alas). Sparks growls his lines with a campy surliness in scenes where he\\u2019s required to \\u201Cbe a prick,\\u201D and then turns on a dime to a paternal warmth when conversing with \\u201Cthe kid.\\u201D At age 41, Ribisi lacks the boyish qualities needed to be regarded as \\u201Ca kid,\\u201D and it\\u2019s worth noting that Petitclerc was in his 20s during the events depicted here. A series of forced chuckles and bare bottoms are utilized to suggest a sense of intimacy among the characters, but when it comes to delving into their relationships, the script remains at surface level. It\\u2019s clear that Petitclerc\\u2019s draft was in need of a rewrite.\\u00A0\\nPeter Greenaway\\u2019s \\u201CEisenstein in Guanajuato\\u201D may have fallen short as a biopic, but as a frank portrayal of a man\\u2019s sexual awakening, it was vividly realized and wholly memorable. There\\u2019s not a single frame of \\u201CPapa: Hemingway in Cuba\\u201D that is guaranteed to linger long in the memory. The director here is Bob Yari, who has found great success as a producer of terrific films such as \\u201CThumbsucker,\\u201D \\u201CThe Painted Veil\\u201D and \\u201CNothing But the Truth.\\u201D This is his first directorial credit since 1989\\u2019s \\u201CMind Games,\\u201D and on the basis of this picture, he should stick to producing. The film is not incompetent per se, aside from the truly awful sound design on the screener that I viewed (hopefully these errors will be cleaned up in subsequent prints). Dueling ambiences were clashing every time the characters opened their mouths, but more importantly, what they had to say just wasn\\u2019t very interesting. Here\\u2019s a film about one of the greatest writers in history that reduces the iconic man\\u2019s mind to the canned insights of a fortune cookie. In what should\\u2019ve been a compelling scene, Hemingway opens up to Myers about an act of infidelity that has haunted him throughout the years. \\u201CMake a decision carefully,\\u201D he cautions Myers. \\u201CConsider every consequence.\\u201D Contrast these generic declarations with Jason Robards\\u2019 shattering monologue in \\u201CMagnolia,\\u201D which recounts similar wounds with a rambling tone and naturalistic poetry that feels like it was ripped directly from the dying man\\u2019s soul.\\u00A0  \\n    Advertisement\\n    \\n          \\n          \\n            \\n              googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\\"div-gpt-ad-block-btf-inline\\"); });\\n            </script>\\n          </div>\\n    </div>\\n  </article>\\n\\n<p>\\n</p><p><a href=\\"/cast-and-crew/jason-isaacs\\">Jason Isaacs</a> once told me that no actor, however good, can make a bad script work, and I kept being reminded of his words while watching \\u201CPapa.\\u201D Faced with stilted dialogue, Sparks and', 'a href=\\"/cast-and-crew/joely-richardson\\">Joely Richardson</a', '(as Hemingway\\u2019s wife, Mary) overact in order to compensate.

How do we know this? Well, for one thing, there\'s a burglary right at the start.And the central character himself, Will Francis (Jude Law), demonstrates a fondness for metaphors in his dialogue. He\'s so fond of them that he even tells us he is fond of them in a climactic speech: \\"I don\'t even know how to be honest anymore. Maybe that\'s why I like metaphors.\\" Then he goes on to describe a metaphor, where a circle represents his family, but it\'s also an enclosure or a cage, and he wants to feel comfortable in it but sometimes he feels trapped in it and sometimes he feels excluded from it.\\n\\n  Advertisement\\n  \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n            googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\'div-gpt-ad-block-atf-inline\'); });\\n          \\n        \\n  \\n\\n\\nIt figures that Will is a partner in a London architecture and landscape design firm, since geometry looms so large in his consciousness. The guiding principle of his company, Green Effects, which is engaged in building a huge development in a squalid section of King\'s Cross, is to promote the concept of \\"built landscape as art, and one that requires as much care as any structure, and as much acknowledgment of design.\\" And there you have another metaphor for \\"Breaking and Entering,\\" a geometrical art-movie exercise defined by its structure and design.The players on Minghella\'s cinematic Parcheesi board are arranged as follows: Will is in a 10-year relationship with Liv (Robin Wright Penn), the Swedish-American mother of a 13-year-old girl, Bea (Poppy Rogers), a gymnast with borderline-autistic behavioral disorders. On the opposing side is Amira (Juliette Binoche), a Bosnian Muslim widow and refugee who lives in a housing project with her difficult 15-year-old son, Miro (Rafi Gavron), who is also a gymnast of sorts. Miro uses his gravity-defying parkour skills to climb and break into buildings to steal electronic equipment for his Serbian uncle\'s burglary operation. To use a metaphor, these two mothers and children are opposing mirrored reflections of each other: blond/brunet, Swedish/Bosnian, upper-class/ working-class, girl/boy ... and Will finds himself caught between them. The symmetry is almost perfect. Which is in part why it all feels so planned, more like an architectural blueprint than a movie.Every once in a while, to serve the higher call of the plotting, someone is called upon to make an utterly baffling and nonsensical move for no good reason. When Will, for example, leaves his business card with the mother of the boy he knows has been burgling his office and doesn\'t anticipate that the boy might feel just a bit paranoid and threatened by this mysterious gesture, you have to wonder how much humanity writer-director Minghella is willing to cede to his characters.To help reinforce the title metaphor, up pops a Romanian prostitute. She is Oana (Vera Farmiga), who abruptly enters Will\'s car one night when he and his partner Sandy (Martin Freeman) are staking out their own office to catch the burglars.  \\n    Advertisement\\n    \\n          \\n          \\n            \\n              googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\\"div-gpt-ad-block-btf-inline\\"); });\\n            \\n          \\n    \\n  \\n\\nNo, it makes no sense whatsoever that Will and Sandy, the heads of this large company, would sit in their parking lot all night like this, or that Oana would bring Will coffee and sit in his car and not even charge him, or ... well, that\'s not the point, is it? She\'s breaking and entering, don\'t you see? She\'s slipping into his car and into his life, getting him to lower the power-windows of his smooth-riding, shock-absorbed existence. But Oana is just a metaphor tricked out in a big, blond wig. Once we get the idea -- actually, long after we get the idea -- the plot drops her like a hot potato. (That\'s a simile, not a metaphor. It\'s also a cliche, and so is she.)With \\"Breaking and Entering,\\" Minghella (best known as the director of \\"The English Patient\\" and \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley,\\" starring Binoche and Law, respectively) seems to be trying his hand at a less ambitious Gonzalez Inarritu/Arriaga movie, like \\"Amores Perros\\" or \\"21 Grams\\" or \\"Babel,\\" with interlocking mini-stories that illustrate how people from different backgrounds affect each other\'s lives. But what are the meaningful connections between these people\'s lives? Are they real and significant, or are they just plot contrivances, the manipulation of pawns in an onscreen board game? The actors are fine, but what does it matter when all they\'re given to play are avatars?In the press notes, Jude Law spells it out: \\"The argument is: Is it worse to steal somebody\'s computer or is it worse to steal somebody\'s heart?\\" That\'s not even a decent metaphor (although, to be fair, the film is not about organ theft). It\'s simply an algebraic formulation: a > b or b ', 'a, where \\"a\\" is \\"computer,\\" \\"b\\" is \\"heart\\" and the nature of the relationship is \\"worse\\"?Expressed in those terms, \\"Breaking and Entering\\" \\n\\n"@en', 'https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/breaking-and-entering-2007')

This new installment in what could be a continuing Linson semi-franchise\\u2014\\u201CArt Linson\\u2019s Tales of Showbiz\\u201D\\u2014has a whole hell of a lot going for it in the individual ingredients department. Linson provided the storyline, which no doubt has any number of a clef elements. The co-screenwriters include Jeffrey Ross, the comedian and Friar\\u2019s Club figurehead who knows where dozens of bodies are buried, the great Richard LaGravenese, and Lewis Friedman, a veteran showbiz gagman and another repository of outrageous tales. Hackford has more than a few first-rate pictures under his belt, including 2004\\u2019s \\u201CRay\\u201D and the underseen \\u201CBlood In, Blood Out.\\u201D And the cast is spectacular, by 1980 standards and by those of 2016. Robert De Niro, Danny DeVito, Harvey Keitel (reuniting with De Niro for the first time since, um, \\u201CLittle Fockers\\u201D in 2010 if I\\u2019m not mistaken), Charles Grodin, Patti Lupone, Cloris Leachman and more, with Edie Falco and Leslie Mann playing the teen roles, relatively speaking. And two raft loads of cameos from real-life comedy legends as themselves.  But the movie never builds enough momentum, emotional or narrative, to get the viewer on its side. De Niro plays Jackie Burke, an aging comic at a career impasse. Like so many movies with aging casts, this one makes a lot of hay out of seniors trying to cope with the digital world. Jackie doesn\\u2019t do such a good job of coping when, one night at a sparsely attended gig, he discovers that a couple of hecklers are razzing him not just for the hell of it, but to provide fodder for their YouTube (or something) series. Jackie head-butts the guy in indignation and winds up battling an assault charge. During his community service (the battle didn\\u2019t go his way; he also ended up doing thirty days) he finds himself serving at a food kitchen alongside Mann\\u2019s Harmony, the troubled daughter of a one-time mobster played by Keitel. The two strike up a friendship that one desperately hopes does not blossom into a romance, while Jackie juggles money troubles, opportunities for gigs, and other challenges in a way that suggest that he thrives on self-defeat in a sense.  One of the movie\\u2019s problems is that it really doesn\\u2019t make clear the particulars of Jackie\\u2019s situation early on. We know that he had once acted the role of \\u201CEddie\\u201D in a popular television sitcom, and that the quasi-\\u201CHoneymooners\\u201D show made his name, his fandom, and whatever\\u2019s left of his fortune. But his existential/artistic quandary only becomes clear as the movie continues. By the time we seem Mann\\u2019s character looking at a vintage vinyl LP titled \\u201CThe Mind of Jackie Burke\\u201D do we understand that Jackie, more than being just a comic who worked blue but got a family television show anyway (think Bob Saget) was not just a shock comic but a social commentator (think George Carlin or even Lenny Bruce). Hackford gives us a lot of nice character notes for Jackie (I particularly liked the scene where he\\u2019s ironing his own clothes while listening to a very obscure Art Blakey LP), but saving this context for last leaves the character, and some of his decisions, a little murky.   \\n    Advertisement\\n    \\n          \\n          \\n            \\n              googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\\"div-gpt-ad-block-btf-inline\\"); });\\n            </script>\\n          </div>\\n    </div>\\n  </article>\\n\\n <p>Then there\\u2019s De Niro himself. The actor has been in a lot of less than good movies over the years, but rarely, or relatively rarely, has he been in movies in which his performance could be cited as a key problem, or lack. Pauline Kael famously excoriated his work in 1981\\u2019s \\u201C<a href=\\"/reviews/true-confessions-1981\\">True Confessions</a>,\\u201D writing \\u201CHe could be a potato, except he\\u2019s thoroughly absorbed in the process of doing nothing.\\u201D But she was a minority voice. As for De Niro\\u2019s work here, it is quite peculiar. In certain individual scenes, playing off DeVito as his much-beset brother, or Keitel\\u2019s boorish patriarchal non-fan, or Grodin as an estranged colleague, he gets a good spark going, at least for a while. But he can\\u2019t figure Burke out as a stand-up. He pitches his delivery somewhere awkwardly between his legendary \\u201CKing of Comedy\\u201D wannabe Rupert Pupkin and his legendary \\u201C<a href=\\"/reviews/midnight-run-1988\\">Midnight Run</a>\\u201D wisecracking bounty hunter <a href=\\"/cast-and-crew/jack-walsh\\">Jack Walsh</a>. And in a scene that\\u2019s sure to be widely cited, and widely disdained, he leads the members of a senior home in a profanely altered rendition of \\u201CMakin\\u2019 Whoopee\\u201D with the ill-advised relish of his work as Fearless Leader in that Rocky and Bullwinkle film of which I try not to speak of anymore. And it\\u2019s in this cartoonish mode that the movie ultimately ends, as he looks on proudly while the end result of a drunken evening of ill-advised whoopee cops the comedian\\u2019s style.

But the best noirs were made in the 1940s and 1950s, before\\ndirectors consciously knew what they were doing (\\u201CWe called them B movies,\\u201D\\nsaid Robert Mitchum).\\nOnce the French named the genre, once a generation of filmmakers\\ncame along who had seen noirs at cinematheques instead of in flea pits, noir\\ncould never again be naive. One of the joys of a great noir like \\u201CDetour\\u201D\\n(1954) is the feeling that it was made by people who took the story perfectly\\nseriously. One of the dangers of modern self-conscious noir, as Pauline Kael\\nwrote in her scathing dismissal of \\u201CBody Heat,\\u201D is that an actress like\\nKathleen Turner comes across \\u201Cas if she were following the marks on the floor\\nmade by the actresses who preceded her.\\u201D\\n\\n  Advertisement\\n  \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n            googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\'div-gpt-ad-block-atf-inline\'); });\\n          \\n        \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd\\nyet if bad modern noir can play like a parody, good noir still has the power to\\nseduce. Yes, Lawrence Kasdan\'s \\u201CBody Heat\\u201D (1981) is aware of the films that\\ninspired it--especially Billy Wilder\'s \\u201CDouble Indemnity\\u201D (1944). But it has a\\npower that transcends its sources. It exploits the personal style of its stars\\nto insinuate itself; Kael is unfair to Turner, who in her debut role played a\\nwoman so sexually confident that we can believe her lover (William Hurt) could\\nbe dazed into doing almost anything for her. The moment we believe that, the\\nmovie stops being an exercise and starts working. (I think the moment occurs in\\nthe scene where she leads Hurt by her hand in that manner a man is least\\ninclined to argue with.)\\nWomen\\nare rarely allowed to be bold and devious in the movies; most directors are\\nmen, and they see women as goals, prizes, enemies, lovers and friends, but\\nrarely as protagonists. Turner\'s entrance in \\u201CBody Heat\\u201D announces that she is\\nthe film\'s center of power. It is a hot, humid night in Florida. Hurt, playing\\na cocky but lazy lawyer named Ned Racine, is strolling on a pier where an\\nexhausted band is listlessly playing. He is behind the seated audience. We can\\nsee straight down the center aisle to the bandstand. All is dark and red and\\norange. Suddenly a woman in white stands up, turns around and walks straight\\ntoward him. This is Matty Walker. To see her is to need her.\\nTurner\\nin her first movie role was an intriguing original. Slender, with hair down to\\nher shoulders, she evoked aspects of Barbara Stanwyck and Lauren Bacall. But\\nthe voice, with its elusive hint of a Latin accent, was challenging. She had \\u201Cangry\\neyes,\\u201D the critic David Thomson observed. And a slight overbite (later\\ncorrected, I think) gave a playful edge to her challenging dialogue (\\u201CYou\'re\\nnot too smart, are you?\\u201D she says soon after meeting him. \\u201CI like that in a\\nman.\\u201D)\\nHurt\\nhad been in one movie before \\u201CBody Heat\\u201D (Ken Russell\'s \\u201CAltered States\\u201D in\\n1980). He was still unfamiliar: a tall, already balding, indolently handsome\\nman with a certain lazy arrogance to his speech, as if amused by his own\\nintelligence. \\u201CBody Heat\\u201D is a movie about a woman who gets a man to commit\\nmurder for her. It is important that the man not be a dummy; he needs to be\\nsmart enough to think of the plan himself. One of the brilliant touches of\\nKasdan\'s screenplay is the way he makes Ned Racine think he is the initiator of\\nMatty Walker\'s plans.  \\n    Advertisement\\n    \\n          \\n          \\n            \\n              googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\\"div-gpt-ad-block-btf-inline\\"); });\\n            \\n          \\n    \\n  \\n\\n\\nFew\\nmovies have done a better job of evoking the weather. Heat, body heat, is a\\nconvention of pornography, where performers routinely complain about how warm\\nthey are (as if lovemaking could cool them off, instead of making them hotter).\\nAlthough air conditioning was not unknown in South Florida in 1981, the\\ncharacters here are constantly in heat; there is a scene where Ned comes home,\\ntakes off his shirt and stands in front of the open refrigerator. The film\\nopens with an inn burning in the distance (\\u201CSomebody\'s torched it to clear the\\nlot,\\u201D Ned says. \\u201CProbably one of my clients.\\u201D) There are other fires. There is\\nthe use of the color red. There is the sense that heat inflames passion and\\nencourages madness.\\nIn\\nthis heat, Matty seems cool. Early in the film there is a justly famous scene\\nwhere Matty brings Ned home from a bar, allegedly to listen to her wind chimes,\\nand then asks him to leave. He leaves, then returns, and looks through a window\\nnext to her front door. She stands inside, dressed in red, calmly returning his\\ngaze. He picks up a chair and throws it through the window, and in the next\\nshot they are embracing. Knowing what we know about Matty, look once again at\\nher expression as she looks back at him. She looks as confident and absorbed as\\na child who has pushed a button and is waiting for a video game to respond.\\nKasdan,\\nborn in 1949, worked in ad agencies before moving to Hollywood to write\\nscreenplays.

Some he has acted in, some he has not. He has gotten the kind of attention young artists dream about, some good, some bad, festival awards, critical raves and critical derision. As an actor, Dolan has a blank and beautiful quality reminiscent of the young Alain Delon, whose almost otherworldly good looks were show-stopping and yet somehow off-putting as well (utilized to great effect in Jean-Paul Melville\'s \\"Le Samoura\\u00EF\\"). Audiences are drawn to such cinematic beauty, but can also be envious, and slightly hostile. (Alfred Hitchcock loved to fill his films with beautiful people and then make horrible things happen to them.) Is there anything there behind that mask of pure beauty?\\u00A0Dolan\'s latest, \\"Tom at the Farm\\" was completed several years ago (before last year\'s \\"Mommy\\") and is the first time he has adapted an extant work for the screen. Based on a play written by Michel Marc Bouchard (and Bouchard wrote the adaptation with Dolan), the adaptation appears to adhere closely to the original (I have not seen the play), with only a couple of scenes where the action is \\"opened up.\\" (Those scenes, on the whole, are not successful.) \\"Tom at the Farm\\" strains to be a psychological thriller but its length (102 minutes) dissipates the tension that should be taut and compressed. This is Dolan\'s first attempt at genre, and while there is much to admire here (mainly the visuals and the score, both stunning), Dolan\'s interests lie in the strange undercurrents of sado-masochism between the two main characters, and it\'s a through-line that deserves more attention. That through-line could have carried the entire movie if Dolan had let go of being faithful to the original.\\u00A0Tom (Dolan) drives through serene and brightly-colored autumn fields to attend the funeral of his boyfriend Guillaume. Once he arrives and meets Guillaume\'s mother Agathe (Lise Roy, who gives the best performance in the film), he learns that his boyfriend was closeted to his mother and had lied that he had a girlfriend. Tom is a greasy-haired boy, dressed in black leather and huge black boots, clomping through the immaculate farmhouse and the rural surrounding environment, a slash of black against the yellow dying corn. Agathe is eager to meet someone who knew her son, but confused and hurt that the never-met girlfriend did not attend the funeral.\\u00A0The emotional pressure in that farmhouse is so extreme that Tom is roped into going along with his dead boyfriend\'s lie. Tom closets himself, in other words. He decides not to read the shaky eulogy he is seen writing in the first image of the film. It\'s an uneasy choice for him to make. More problems arise when Francis (Pierre-Yves Cardinal), Guillaumes\'s swaggering older brother, who still lives at home with his mother, struts into the kitchen bare-chested, seething with hostility towards the blonde urban interloper. Francis knew his brother\'s secret life, has homophobic contempt for it, and has banned all of the gay friends from coming to the funeral (there\'s a confrontation with one of them at the back of the church). Francis is so intimidating, so awful really, that it\'s strange that Tom doesn\'t just leave immediately after the funeral. But the farm exerts a pull on Tom (the real story of the film). Tom is hypnotized into the dysfunctional workings of the family, their subverted energies working on him like a drug. He can\'t seem to leave. The only time he shows rage and frustration is when he is alone in his car after the funeral. Agathe becomes increasingly frayed. Francis picks fights with Tom, one particularly horrible one in the cornfield, with Tom getting torn to shreds by the razor-sharp dead corn stalks. In one terrible moment, Francis spits into Tom\'s open mouth. But one day, Francis teaches Tom how to milk cows. Then another day, Tom helps birth a calf, and cries with emotion afterwards. Francis reveals that he used to take dance classes, and in one haunting scene, Francis and Tom ballroom dance through the empty barn, Francis dipping Tom back gallantly, the scene moving to romantic slo-mo.\\u00A0What Dolan appears to be going for is a portrait of what could be seen as Stockholm Syndrome or perhaps the beginnings of a possible folie \\u00E0 deux\\u00A0situation. Francis and Tom hate each other, want to be each other, role-reverse, flirt, lash out. Tom is relatively submissive to Francis, taking the beatings, even encouraging them, and Francis senses that, takes pleasure in it. There\'s a sexual dance going on throughout, reminiscent of the murdering duo Leopold and Loeb (especially in the portrayal of the characters in 1959\'s \\"Compulsion\\", highlighting the hypnotic cult-like Master-Slave dynamic), or the novels of Patricia Highsmith, filled with doubling isolated characters. Francis won\'t let Tom leave, throwing obstacles in his way. Tom\'s cell phone doesn\'t work. He doesn\'t just walk down to the main road and hitch a ride. He stays. Francis has no friends, Francis hates gay people, swaggers like a rooster, glories in his singularity. But Tom\'s beautiful blank face before him is dying\\u00A0to be punched, or kissed, or marked in some way. These are the best sections of the film. It\'s really the story, and Dolan\'s intense interest in them is clear in the lingering way these scenes are shot.But as the film continues on and on (it\'s way too long), and Sarah (Evelyne Brochu), a city friend of Tom\'s shows up, pretending to be the girlfriend in order to put Agathe\'s mind at ease, \\"Tom at the Farm\\" unravels. There\'s not enough structure to these different threads. It could work on the stage where movement and place and time are necessarily compressed, but on film it feels artificial, not fully worked out.\\u00A0Beautiful visuals abound throughout (Andr\\u00E9 Turpin, who also shot \\"Mommy\\", is the cinematographer), and there\'s a moody high-contrast look to the landscape (bright trees and bright corn behind dark shadows and fog) that speaks of secrets, torment, hope. The lush and heavy-on-the-strings score of Gabriel Yared is a clue to what Dolan was after. The score punctuates all of the scenes, casual or intense, adding portentous emotion, tension, fear of what is coming. It\'s a melodramatic score, and \\"Tom at the Farm\\" works when it is a family melodrama. These are out-there people with outrageous emotional lives, subsisting on lies and denial, and the abyss between what they think their lives are and what their lives', 'i>really</i', 'are is enormous. All of them choose denial. They get tied to one another by their shared lies, and their unspoken agreement to keep on lying. The score supports that uneasy and terrible energy. The visuals, like the score, are exaggerated and stylistic, starting off with the helicopter shot following Tom\'s car into the countryside, making him seem dwarfed by the surrounding land, a tiny figure entering an unknown isolated world. It\'s a nod to Hitchcock or Kubrick.\\u00A0The thriller elements, the chase scenes, the reveal of horrifying secrets, feel like add-ons, clumsily done and unmotivated, especially when compared to the dark and deep dance (metaphorical and literal) of violence and sex going on between Tom and Francis. That\'s the real juice and guts of the film. It could be an answer to the nagging question throughout: Why the hell doesn\'t Tom just leave? In thrillers, people are always making ridiculous choices that go against their self-interest, or ignoring the red flags in front of them of potential predators. In a well-done thriller, you mostly forgive the unreal quality of these moments. But \\"Tom at the Farm\\" does not foreground the thriller aspect enough (although the score tries mightily to do so), and so Tom doesn\'t seem quite real. Nobody does.\\n\\n  Advertisement\\n  \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n            googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\'div-gpt-ad-block-atf-inline\'); });\\n          \\n        \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n"@en', 'https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/tom-at-the-farm-2015')

And in a town that already has one show about a precocious young tyke (an indifferently received revival of Annie) on the boards?  The answer, I suspect, is very much yes, as the New York theatre moves into awards-season overdrive in the race for this year\\u2019s Tony Awards.  Britain is usually responsible for producing plenty of Tony contenders, but not this year, where the Best Play nominees are likely to be a fully American quartet.  That means, in turn, that 10-year-old Milly Shapiro (the one of four Matildas performing in this Broadway production I saw) has a lot riding on her slight shoulders. And yet, as Roald Dahl\\u2019s diminutive character would be the first to make clear, mess with this little girl at your peril.  As directed by Matthew Warchus, Matilda has always been the little show that could.

At the same time, Bertie Carvel, making his Broadway debut, seems to have adjusted his award-winning termagant of a Trunchbull up a notch, his arm-flapping intensity lending the English actor the feel of a breast-plated whirligig.  But the tremendous heart and intelligence of the piece remains undimmed, and among the new recruits, special kudos must go to Gabriel Ebert\\u2019s Mr Wormwood: a lanky, sartorially challenged spiv with a knockout voice. And at the show\\u2019s capacious heart, one can only thrill to the tiny yet mightily determined Shapiro as she takes the audience on Matilda\\u2019s journey from a surrounding loutishness and neglect through to a world of learning, literature and, by the final curtain, love.

But Neil Armfield\\u2019s fine production, first seen at Hampstead last year, has turned a famous flop into a genuine hit, greatly helped by Rupert Everett\\u2019s brilliant and deeply felt performance as Wilde.  Saying that someone was born to play a particular role is a clich\\u00E9, but watching Everett here it also seems a statement of fact. For long sections of the play you feel that you are in the company of Oscar himself, first immediately after his libel case against the Marquess of Queensberry has collapsed, and then when he is reunited with Bosie in Naples after two punishing years of imprisonment.  Everett\\u2019s Wilde is an older, sadder and wiser man than the wicked wit of popular imagination, and even his moments of humour are shot through with deep melancholy and a passivity that paradoxically becomes dramatically enthralling as he awaits arrest at the Cadogan Hotel. Why did Wilde resist the chance to flee when he knew the game was up? Why after his hellish time in Reading Gaol did he resume his relationship with the faithless Bosie?  Hare suggests that the reason was unconditional love and Everett\\u2019s beautifully judged performance makes it clear that Wilde is aware of all Bosie\\u2019s faults, but for him love is neither to be calculated nor adjusted to circumstances. As he declares in one of the play\\u2019s most telling and affecting lines: \\u201CThe everyday world is shrouded. We see it dimly. Only when we love do we see the true person\\u2026 Love is not the illusion. Life is.\\u201D Watching this fine revival one realises with a jolt that the often prickly Hare is, like Wilde, a romantic at heart.  It is moving to watch Everett in the role, not least because his gilded youth is far behind him and in this production he finally seems to be redeeming an often squandered talent. I don\\u2019t know if he has been binging on pasta and ice cream or is artfully padded up, but he is plausibly obese, and beautifully captures the rueful wit and the valour of Wilde as he faces the bleakest of futures following Bosie\\u2019s last act of treachery. \\n\\t\\t\\tRelated Articles\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    The Judas Kiss, Hampstead Theatre, review\\n                \\n\\n\\t13 Sep 2012\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    The importance of being Rupert\\n                \\n\\n\\t01 Oct 2012\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    Oscar Wilde\\u2019s nemesis, the \\"scarlet\\" Marquess of Queensberry: review\\n                \\n\\n\\t02 Apr 2013\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    \'Nothing worse than gay dads,\' says Rupert Everett\\n                \\n\\n\\t16 Sep 2012\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t Freddie Fox is persuasive, too, as Wilde\\u2019s beloved nemesis, blond, petulant and heartless, yet convinced of his own righteousness, while Cal MacAninch is deeply touching as Wilde\\u2019s loyal friend and former lover, Robert Ross.

I can only say that the American dramatist Sarah Ruhl has come up with something rather wonderful: a period drama that is funny, original and genuinely touching. It is also based on historical fact.  In the late 19th century, many women (and a few men) were treated for hysteria with an electrical vibrator. They experienced orgasms, known as paroxysms, but it was regarded as a strictly medical procedure. Many of the women had never experienced sexual fulfilment in the marital bed and the treatment seemed to do them a power of good. Men were treated with a fearsome instrument called the Chattanooga that worked on the prostate gland and seemed to do the trick too.  The action is set in New York State where Dr Givings practices his calling in his upstairs consulting room, singing the praises of Thomas Edison as he goes about his work.  The contrast between the doctor\\u2019s briskly efficient manner and his patients\\u2019 groans and gasps of pleasure is often deliciously comic, but a suitably Victorian propriety prevails. There is no nudity, and the procedures all take place beneath a crisp white sheet. \\n\\t\\t\\tRelated Articles\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    Does masturbating really make people less creative?\\n                \\n\\n\\t07 Aug 2014\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    Eric and Little Ern: \'warm, funny and moving\'\\n                \\n\\n\\t21 Nov 2013\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    What makes a play popular?\\n                \\n\\n\\t22 Nov 2013\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t Downstairs in Dr Givings\\u2019s living room however matters are less happy. The doctor\\u2019s wife, Catherine, played with a beguiling mixture of wit, curiosity and sadness by Natalie Casey, has recently given birth to a baby girl but is unable to provide her child with enough milk. A black wet-nurse is called in, who is only able to provide the service because her own child died in infancy and the often strained relationship between these two bruised and unhappy women is most delicately caught. The play\\u2019s rich mixture is further enhanced by a lovelorn artist (an excellent Edward Bennett) who seeks treatment from the doctor and briefly captures the heart of his wife.  There is great tenderness in Ruhl\\u2019s portrayal of her beautifully observed characters and though there is a lot of pain in this play, there is a lot of laughter too. I particularly liked the scene in which the doctor\\u2019s wife, who is entirely ignorant of what goes on in her husband\\u2019s consulting room, opens the locked door with a hatpin and gets one of his patients (played by a now happily radiant Flora Montgomery) to show her what happens there. It\\u2019s a lovely moment of female solidarity, in which both women behave like naughty schoolgirls.  There is also a fine scene when they ask the wet nurse if she has ever experienced the feelings on offer in the consulting room, and the dignified black woman, movingly played by Madeline Appiah, says it sounds like what happens when husband and wife have \\u201Crelations\\u201D. Neither of the white characters can believe such a thing is possible.  Laurence Boswell\\u2019s outstanding production, with a delightfully detailed two-storey design by Simon Kenny, discovers all the play\\u2019s humour and moments of deeper feeling, and one leaves the theatre with a warm glow of pleasure.

There was a picturesque flurry of snow, Christmas lights twinkled, and, if I\\u2019m not mistaken, angels descended from the skies and sang madrigals. It was a deeply satisfying episode for fans who had become anxious after the wonky, half-cooked storylines of series two.  But romance couldn\\u2019t be the answer indefinitely, could it? Julian Fellowes, the writer, knows that while we love a happy ending, there\\u2019s nothing like a bit of jeopardy to keep us watching. So, in a canny reflection of our straitened times, series three of the nation\\u2019s best-loved costume drama began with the revelation that the Crawleys had lost nearly all of their fortune, thanks to an ill-judged investment in the Canadian railways.  In fact, so keen was Fellowes to ensure that Downton Abbey had contemporary relevance that he also had Hugh Bonneville\\u2019s Earl of Grantham utter the words: \\u201CI don\\u2019t want to be the earl who dropped the torch and let the flame go out.\\u201D For one agonising moment, it looked as if Bonneville was going to break the fourth wall and give a knowing wink to the camera. Especially since Bonneville was also the star of the BBC\\u2019s spoof Olympics comedy, Twenty Twelve.  This felt like a programme back to its best, the one we fell in love with back in 2010. The script was tight; the detail was there.Fellowes\\u2019s gift then and now has been to assemble a large and varied cast of characters and make them interrelate in a plausible fashion, which is where the BBC rival Upstairs Downstairs \\u2014 with its pared-down household, all of whom stared at one another as if they were strangers \\u2014 so obviously failed.  And then there was the addition of Hollywood glamour. Shirley MacLaine\\u2019s much-anticipated entrance as Cora\\u2019s mother, Martha, was a masterclass in how to command an audience. \\n\\t\\t\\tRelated Articles\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    Downton Abbey, ITV1, review\\n                \\n\\n\\t23 Sep 2012\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    Brits Damian Lewis, Maggie Smith win at Emmys\\n                \\n\\n\\t24 Sep 2012\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    Emmys 2012: a bad night for the BBC\\n                \\n\\n\\t24 Sep 2012\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    Emmys: Modern Family is a predictable win\\n                \\n\\n\\t24 Sep 2012\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    Downton Abbey, ITV1, review\\n                \\n\\n\\t30 Sep 2012\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    Downton Abbey, ITV1, review\\n                \\n\\n\\t07 Oct 2012\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t As she swished grandly out of her automobile onto the Downton drive, the cast looked quite terrified of her; maybe they were acting (Martha was pretty scary), or maybe they were simply in awe of MacLaine\\u2019s formidable reputation. Anyhow, Martha was a breath of fresh Transatlantic air; and humorously shrewd about the ways of the English.  \\u201CIt\\u2019s so strange to think of the English embracing change,\\u201D she said, moments after her arrival. Maggie Smith\\u2019s Dowager Countess looked as though she had just been offered a mug of luke-warm Bovril.  But, ultimately, tensions are forgiven and forgotten at Downton. Halfway through last night\\u2019s episode, Mary nearly called off the wedding \\u2014 \\u201CHow can you be so disappointing, Matthew?\\u201D \\u2014 but by the end, she was at the altar, and the whole house, both upstairs and downstairs, breathed a sigh of relief.  As she stood beside Matthew, Mary promised him she would be \\u201Cunpredictable\\u201D \\u2014 in a good way. It was a rather sweet moment but hard to imagine: for one of Downton\\u2019s most lovable qualities is that it is predictable. Good will conquer evil, love will conquer hate, and the Dowager Countess will conquer her distaste for vulgar Americans. Well, maybe.

And in a town that already has one show about a precocious young tyke (an indifferently received revival of Annie) on the boards?  The answer, I suspect, is very much yes, as the New York theatre moves into awards-season overdrive in the race for this year\\u2019s Tony Awards.  Britain is usually responsible for producing plenty of Tony contenders, but not this year, where the Best Play nominees are likely to be a fully American quartet.  That means, in turn, that 10-year-old Milly Shapiro (the one of four Matildas performing in this Broadway production I saw) has a lot riding on her slight shoulders. And yet, as Roald Dahl\\u2019s diminutive character would be the first to make clear, mess with this little girl at your peril.  As directed by Matthew Warchus, Matilda has always been the little show that could. Since its Stratford-upon-Avon launch late in 2010, it has stolen the thunder of any number of higher-profile competitors in the West End and now, just possibly, it might do so abroad. The advance sale at Broadway\\u2019s Sam S Shubert Theatre has been pegged near the \\u00A39 million mark \\u2014 far more than its original advance in London, where ticket prices and production costs are, of course, far lower.

At the same time, Bertie Carvel, making his Broadway debut, seems to have adjusted his award-winning termagant of a Trunchbull up a notch, his arm-flapping intensity lending the English actor the feel of a breast-plated whirligig.  But the tremendous heart and intelligence of the piece remains undimmed, and among the new recruits, special kudos must go to Gabriel Ebert\\u2019s Mr Wormwood: a lanky, sartorially challenged spiv with a knockout voice. And at the show\\u2019s capacious heart, one can only thrill to the tiny yet mightily determined Shapiro as she takes the audience on Matilda\\u2019s journey from a surrounding loutishness and neglect through to a world of learning, literature and, by the final curtain, love.

I have spent years going to noisy gigs but nothing was as ear-meltingly painful as the squawking the Beliebers made for their idol. How much more terrifying would the hormonal war cry be in the presence of five times as much teen dream?  Thankfully, my ears survived. Prompted by the band to scream whenever proceedings needed a lift, the audience did at times sound as if 20,000 hungry seagulls had crashed through the dome of the O2. But just as the X Factor boy band are a little older and more Britishly laid back than Bieber, so their fans proved to be less hysterical cult followers and more giggly girls-next-door at a giant pyjama party.  Charm, cheekiness and a smattering of chantalong hits have propelled Simon Cowell\\u2019s prot\\u00E9g\\u00E9s extraordinarily fast to a global arena tour, often packing in two shows a day. The X Factor has proved it can pick out likeable stars, but the truncated TV format fails badly to teach stagecraft. One Direction may pride themselves on being the boyband who don\\u2019t do the cheesy dance routines, but over two hours, with their unexceptional voices and a stodgy section of ballads, what the lads were in dire need of was some kind of showmanship.  They casually strolled, they jumped up and down, and at the chorus they lunged and crunched with some defiant arm-chopping. While Bieber was provocatively dangled like shark bait in a cage over the grabbing hands of his audience, One Direction floated over theirs in an open swing with the look of window cleaners on a night out. As their lyrics demonstrate, like most young men the five-piece have got sex on the brain, but without much in the way of physical display the evening had the dangerous allure of an episode of Glee.

It is the first musical that Kevin Spacey has staged at the august establishment since he took charge of it almost a decade ago.  It was hard not to detect just the mildest hint of disdain upon Sir John Gielgud\\u2019s patrician features as I walked past his photograph on the staircase. Laurence Olivier, at least, would have been enthusiastic: anything goes, the actor-manager riposted when some of the grander elements of his profession asked him if he felt it was prudent for his National Theatre to cheapen itself with a production of Guys and Dolls.  Seven years ago, when I was appointed as this newspaper\\u2019s theatre critic, I was told I had got the job because I had been deemed to be the one applicant who was unlikely to \\u201Cgo native\\u201D in theatreland.

I am afraid I\\u2019m now going to have to own up, too, to being seduced by Kiss Me, Kate. This one has the advantage, however, of an intelligent plot, which could reasonably be described as the template for Michael Frayn\\u2019s over-rated Noises Off: it focuses on the on- and off-stage dramas involved in the making of an all-singing, all-dancing production of The Taming of the Shrew.  Quality control has, alas, been an issue with Sir Trevor\\u2019s work in recent years \\u2013 one recalls with a shudder his production of Gone with the Wind \\u2013 but he has paid so much attention here to getting the look and feel of the show-within-a-show right that I soon started to feel I was getting two five-star epics for the price of one. \\n\\t\\t\\tRelated Articles\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    Stephen Mear: Old-style master of the modern chorus line\\n                \\n\\n\\t22 Nov 2012\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    Sir Trevor Nunn: rep theatre strangling West End\\n                \\n\\n\\t25 Nov 2012\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    2012 Christmas Shows preview\\n                \\n\\n\\t30 Nov 2012\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    Twelfth Night, Apollo Theatre, Seven magazine\\n                \\n\\n\\t30 Nov 2012\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    Uncle Vanya, Vaudeville Theatre: review\\n                \\n\\n\\t16 Nov 2012\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t Hannah Waddingham makes a great job of the Hollywood star who has been reluctanly cast as Katharine in Shrew \\u2013 the Musical against Alex Bourne, as her former husband who possesses an ego almost as big as the codpiece he dons as Petruchio.

Yet for much of its length the play is wonderfully funny \\u2013 though it proved a little too farcical on opening night.  Just as the piece was reaching its pivotal point, in which the boozy Irish craic starts turning into something darker, the tenement door got jammed as a character was about to make her crucial entrance to mourn the death of her son in the war between the Free-Staters and the Republican \\u201CDie Hards\\u201D.  The knock came but the door refused to budge. Improvising wildly, Ciaran Hinds in the role of the feckless, workshy, hard-drinking Captain Boyle asked if anyone had a key. In contrast, Sinead Cusack, playing his long-suffering wife, gave the stout door a good kick. But it remained resolutely stuck. The stage manager came on to announce that the performance would have to stop while the problem was fixed, the curtains were closed and three minutes later the action resumed to audience cheers and applause.  This was unfortunate as poor Bernadette McKenna in the role of the bereaved mother then had to deliver her crucial speech in which she begs \\u201CThe Sacred Heart of the Crucified Jesus\\u201D to \\u201Ctake away our hearts o\\u2019stone and give us hearts o\\u2019flesh\\u2026 Take away this murdherin\\u2019', 'correct', 'hate \\u2026 an\\u2019 give us Thine own eternal love!\\u201D \\n\\t\\t\\tRelated Articles\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    Three Days In May, Trafalgar Studios\\n                \\n\\n\\t03 Nov 2011\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    Stalin almost stole my soul\\n                \\n\\n\\t15 Nov 2011\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                                                        \\n                    \'The world we\\u2019re presenting is not pretty\'\\n                \\n\\n\\t14 Nov 2011\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t It is to the credit of both actress and audience that the mood of farcical jollity quickly gave way to rapt attention.  But the problematic door seemed symptomatic of a staging that while good in parts, never quite achieves the seamless flow of mood from wild comedy to deepest tragedy. Almost all the performances in Howard Davies\\u2019s production, a joint venture between the NT and Dublin\\u2019s Abbey Theatre are a little too over-emphatic, with characters talking too loudly and often missing the eloquent Irish street poetry of O\\u2019Casey\\u2019s writing and his amazing ability to turn the mood on a sixpence.  Nevertheless there is much to admire. As the strutting puffed up peacock of the title, who calls himself Captain Boyle because he once sailed on a coal ship from Ireland to Liverpool, Hinds finds a rich vein of comedy as this boozy self-aggrandising waster. When he believes he has come into a small fortune, his grandiosity is hilariously caught as the spectacularly decayed tenement apartment is filled with expensive new furniture and he patronises his friends and neighbours like a Lord of the Manor.  Risteard Cooper plays his sponging fair-weather friend Joxer with a mixture of feigned bonhomie and an underlying weasel-like viciousness that is horribly persuasive, while Sinead Cusack discovers a deeply moving tragic depth as all the family\\u2019s frail hopes come crashing down.  The play\\u2019s final minutes, in which death and disgrace suddenly give way to a scene of lurching drunkenness that is as bleakly comic as anything in Beckett are superbly achieved. And when the show settles down, and the door functions properly, this patchy production of a masterpiece might just become a great one. \\n"@en', 'https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-reviews/8894749/Juno-and-the-Paycock-National-Theatre-review.html')
