This is because it’s far busier being meat-headed than clever. Rather than Bourne-esque spy thrills with a science-fiction upgrade, it’s more like the sort of pseudo-high-concept trash a Nicolas Cage (eg, Next) or Jason Statham (Crank) might lend their names to. And for all the attempts to spin it as a contemporary riff on Frankenstein, it’s the movie itself that’s a weird, lurching and unevenly stitched hybrid of stolen body parts.Costner’s suitability as this buzzcut thug is highly debatable. He seems mainly committed to making him as unsympathetic as possible – Statham at his most bulldog-like has a thousand times more charm. The one big laugh comes from a complete stranger on the receiving end of Costner’s fists for being a bit snobbish: “Who punches someone in a patisserie, you animal?!”. More in this vein might have helped. Dropping in on Pope’s widow (Gal Gadot) and young daughter, Costner has to perform impossible gradations of partial recall while also being an alarming psycho they don’t know from Adam, and certainly can’t summon the strangely sweet, childlike spectre of Boris Karloff.

And for all the attempts to spin it as a contemporary riff on Frankenstein, it’s the movie itself that’s a weird, lurching and unevenly stitched hybrid of stolen body parts.Costner’s suitability as this buzzcut thug is highly debatable. He seems mainly committed to making him as unsympathetic as possible – Statham at his most bulldog-like has a thousand times more charm. The one big laugh comes from a complete stranger on the receiving end of Costner’s fists for being a bit snobbish: “Who punches someone in a patisserie, you animal?!”. More in this vein might have helped. Dropping in on Pope’s widow (Gal Gadot) and young daughter, Costner has to perform impossible gradations of partial recall while also being an alarming psycho they don’t know from Adam, and certainly can’t summon the strangely sweet, childlike spectre of Boris Karloff. He comes over more like a delusional sex pest.Really, though, it’s the film’s gratuitous sadism which starts pummelling the fun out of it, blow by blow. An early torture scene with Pope getting a cattle-prod to the face sets the grim tone, and a female henchvillain gets to know the underside of a heavy table lamp more repeatedly than is strictly necessary.I'm five years away from human trials!”, wails Tommy Lee Jones’s rogue neurosurgeon in Criminal, before being press-ganged by the CIA into doing a complete memory transplant within 48 hours.

Dropping in on Pope’s widow (Gal Gadot) and young daughter, Costner has to perform impossible gradations of partial recall while also being an alarming psycho they don’t know from Adam, and certainly can’t summon the strangely sweet, childlike spectre of Boris Karloff.

And for all the attempts to spin it as a contemporary riff on Frankenstein, it’s the movie itself that’s a weird, lurching and unevenly stitched hybrid of stolen body parts.Costner’s suitability as this buzzcut thug is highly debatable. He seems mainly committed to making him as unsympathetic as possible – Statham at his most bulldog-like has a thousand times more charm. The one big laugh comes from a complete stranger on the receiving end of Costner’s fists for being a bit snobbish: “Who punches someone in a patisserie, you animal?!”. More in this vein might have helped. Dropping in on Pope’s widow (Gal Gadot) and young daughter, Costner has to perform impossible gradations of partial recall while also being an alarming psycho they don’t know from Adam, and certainly can’t summon the strangely sweet, childlike spectre of Boris Karloff. He comes over more like a delusional sex pest.Really, though, it’s the film’s gratuitous sadism which starts pummelling the fun out of it, blow by blow. An early torture scene with Pope getting a cattle-prod to the face sets the grim tone, and a female henchvillain gets to know the underside of a heavy table lamp more repeatedly than is strictly necessary.It’s wanton, low-down entertainment without the flair to pull this stuff off, or the neural stem cells to make wit or logic much of a priority.\n",
