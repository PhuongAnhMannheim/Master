      "reviewBody: As a fan of 'Descendants' from the beginning, I have watched all three movies the second they were released. Descendants has captivated my love and attention from the very first movie.Unfortunately, the third movie feels somewhat out of place in the series. It feels very different from the other movies, and it's not always in a good way. Audrey's story arc feels unrealistic and forced. Actress Sarah Jeffrey plays a convincing enough villain, but she became so evil so quickly that it feels forced. Her redemption arc at the end feels random and unnecessary. That being said, I did enjoy The Queen of Mean storyline.My other issue was Hades. The character was so anticipated and everyone expected him to be the next big villan. While his storyline was satisfying enough, I can't say that I wasn't disappointed. He was barely in the movie, and I found myself wanting more.It's also worth mentioning that most of the songs just weren't as good as the songs from 1 and 2.In conclusion, Descendants 3 was a good enough movie, and Disney Channel has one again given people something to enjoy. As much as I had fun watching, I can't see myself loving it as much as the first two.\n",

      "reviewBody: Ever since the first Descendants back in 2015, it started a lot of fans for this epic 3 movies saga. With the 3rd movie of The Descendants are both good & the bad. For starters, the casting. The actors of Descendants 3 have really done parts as their characters very well as well the returning actress: Sarah Jeffery really make the movie as good as Fairy Godmother in Cinderella. In fact, Audrey is both good and bad of being a tragic character. As she supposed to be the one who suppose to be the queen with Ben as her king not Mal. There's some good and corny moments towards Audrey being a new \"queen\" can be somewhat unnecessary seeing of the new character of Descendants 3: Hades. Saying of which, Cheyenne Jackson as Hades is somehow a really creative character. I wish Hades could have been the main villain of the movie, but he still perform a very good as the God of War himself even when he gets weird. Story itself is somewhat rather interesting that having three different arcs in one movie can be a total mess, but still pretty good in some parts like Mal & Uma finally becoming friends again, as well wiping up Mal's and Audrey's rivalry. And, the music this time around is really adds towards characters such as a necessary song number like Audrey: Queen of Mean to unnecessary song number like Evia: One Kiss. But, one flaw about the movie is that it could just expanded other characters that really deserved to be in the spotlight such as Hades, Squirmy, Squeaky, and Dizzy. Plus, there's some plot holes that the movie could have used such as explaining about Audrey plan & Hades Ember is powerful yet the Fairy Godmother wand is said to be powerful. There are some plot holes that leaving the viewers to notice from the previous movies. Besides the faults, Descendants 3 is a wonderful movie and a epic conclusion to a movie saga like this. While there's are some plot holes that didn't explain in the movie, but it's still holds up a good movie and giving a farewell the main 4 a concluding goodbye. Overall, I recommended watch this movie for those are fans of this 3 movies saga of 4 Descendants from Disney Villains. As well a farewell to the late death of Cameron Boyce. Farewell old friend.\n",

      "reviewBody: Love love loved D3!!! What a perfect ending for the trilogy!Mr Ortega made sure the messages of \"family,\" \"acceptance,\" \"second chances,\" and \"celebrating our differences\" came ringing through with fabulous music and dancing that was a lot of fun to watch -a lot of work for the actors too, I bet - but so worth it for the viewers.It was great to see Ben as the Beast finally. Audrey's turn to the bad side, especially after her Grammy berated her for letting the prince slip through her fingers, was a great way to show that bad can come from either side of the barrier. Then Hades part, although smaller than expected, brought the good in from the \"wrong side of the tracks\" - and his pride for his little girl was evident even though Mal had always felt he had abandoned her. I was so happy to see their relationship repair bit by bit as each of their scenes progressed. Dizzy and the Smee twins didn't play big parts but this story has always been about the core 4 anyway - exactly as I wanted to see - with a pop of the newbies here and there to let us know there was a program initiate to get more VKs to Auradon as Ben dreamed to make happen. Mal's unintentional selfishness to want to lock the barrier for good to keep the core 4s lives good and Auradon safe was a great way for Evie to teach about sharing the good life with all of the villain kids.All 3 movies in the Descendants franchise were absolutely fabulous! The last 4 years have been worth the wait and D3 topped it all off with a perfect ending. Watched D and D2 again before watching D3 4 times last night. Seriously enjoyed every bit of all 3 Descendants DCOMs and felt they flowed wonderfully!!! Previously reading the books between the movies added to that flow and were just as enjoyable. What a wonderful feel-good Disney story with strong messages about important aspects of life that children need to be taught so we can hopefully end hate someday. Our real life world could learn a lot from this trilogy and I can't wait to pass on my Descendants DVDs and soundtracks to my grandchildren one day so they can learn about acceptance in a fun and creative way.The dedication at the start and the tribute at the end for the extraordinary young man, Cameron Boyce, were real tear jerkers but I am so glad he is getting recognition he so deserves! Hope his legacy lives on forever because he lived his life sending out the same messages that the Disney Channel stands for - family, acceptance, caring, sharing, helping, and celebrating differences. His family have a right to be so proud of Cameron and I thank them for sharing him with us for all of these years (since 2011 for me).Regardless of what I say or others say - watch D3 yourself and make your own determination if you like it or not.\n",

I admit the songs are great, the message is good, but even if it's Disney and it most likely cater to younger audiences, this poor writing and the amount of plot holes are inexcusable.\n",
      "Usually, I don't write reviews for movies, but I had high expectations for this one because I like the concept of villains turning good, fairy-tales having twists, etc. This movie had the potential to be great, but it failed at it miserable from multiple points.\n",
      "The plot is a mess and the characters' actions make no sense. I've heard this is an adaptation from a novel, so a lot of things could have been emitted and changed. It is possible that books actually had a good reason for whatever was happening, but that was never explained in the movie. So I'm going off from only knowing the movies.\n",
      "Let's start with the characters, their actions, and background, and their connections to the plot.Audrey: Although a bit better, but just like the others, she has know idea how to be a good villain. Here are the reasons\n",
      "1. (1. is more a spoiler because it wasn't in the music video) Audrey hates the VKs, but only turns Mal old and doesn't do anything to the others\n",
      "2.Audrey makes the knight's armors fight when she could have just turn the VKs to stone like she did later on. She also does nothing to Uma after seeing that somehow Uma makes Mal strongerNow, moving to a new character.\n",
      "Hades: Leaving Greek mythology aside and looking at the Hades from Hercules, there are a lot of things that doesn't make sense regarding him.\n",
      "1. In Descendant 1, the barrier came down for a few minutes. Maleficent flew out to attack Auradon. Hades, being a god and having his ember, clearly could have escaped, so why didn't he?\n",
      "2. Why does he even need an ember in the first place when both in the Greek mythology and in the Hercules movie he didn't need one?\n",
      "3. Why is Hades on the Isle instead of Tartarus If he was deemed so dangerous? Who even managed to imprison him and how does the Isle even able to contain him? It couldn't have been the fairy wand that made force field since a fairy's power cannot be stronger than a god's. Also, who manages the Underworld and what happens to the dead if their ruler is imprisoned? Did they capture all the Underworld gods and creatures who served Hades? If not, the world should already be in chaos.Moving on to Mal:\n",
      "1. Considering how powerful her mother's scepter was and how completely unguarded it was, after failing to get the wand, why didn't she think to get her mother's scepter in the first movie, turn everyone to stone, get the wand, and then take down the barrier? And also, why didn't no one increase the security considering how scared they were of Uma and other VKs?\n",
      "2. Hades said she is Half Hades, so why is she so weak? When Hercules only had a bit of his godliness left, he could easily lift statues, vehicles,etc. Yet Mal, who is a demigod, has absolutely no power and couldn't even defeat Uma in Descendant 2.\n",
      "3. (3 is more a spoiler since it wasn't in the music video) When all of Auradon was in danger and she was clearly losing, she didn't think of flying to Hades and bringing him out to easily defeat Audrey and turn everything back to normal, but when Audrey, now a villain, was about to die, she was willing to risk to bringing Hades out. Makes no sense just like her idea to close the barrier forever, considering that Hades is her dad and she trusts him enough to go to Auradon and save a villain (Audrey)As for the ending, I get that it wanted to point out the hypocrisy, but the fact that Audrey wasn't punished at all whatsoever and that her not dying is considered a good deed done by Hades makes no sense. Cinderella's stepmom and step-sisters were imprisoned for being abusive only, and yet the one who dishonored her own mother by going complete Maleficent on them and put everyone at danger faces no punishment. This is ridiculous just as releasing all the villains. That's literally what Maleficent wanted. Were they only afraid of her and Hades or why was it ok to release imprisoned villains with their full power without taking any measures to protect themselves against said villains?Also, considering how every time Auradon is in danger, they have to rely on the VKS, I really wonder how in the world did they imprison Hades or other powerful individuals.\n",

Parents willingly let their kids go you they can live a better life. However, one of the criminals attempts to break the barrier.

Audrey (Sarah Jeffery) was not too happy to hear about her ex, getting married to Mal, and changes her hair and wardrobe. . . thank you again, Fredericks. With a wicked wand, she raises havoc that only kids from south of the border can solve while picking grapes (symbolic Latino give away).

The idea of all the Disney villains being forced to live locked up (my magic) on an island by themselves does have a fun \"Escape from New York\" vibe to it, but this is the Disney Channel so there's teenybopper singing, dancing, and angst. For this installment, there is now a lottery of sorts where the children of a villains can get a a reprieve and get off the island, as did Mal, Evie, Carlos, and Jay. I found it odd how happy all the villain kids were for those chosen (this time the descendants Mr. Smee, Lady Tremaine, and Dr. Facilier's [they're really desperate for villains with that one]) when it wasn't them picked, but that's the good natured attitude of this film about evil people. Another annoyance is the film is padded out with some flashback musical montage sequences from the first two installments. Maybe the classic sins-of-the-father themes were an interesting starting point, as was the \"Escape from New York\" Disney villain prison island, but the songs are annoying and the petty teen drama is a lot to suffer through. Honestly, my favorite moment watching this film was hearing a cover of a T-Rex song during a milk commercial. But again, I was not the target audience for this film and my elementary age children absolutely loved it.\n",

      "\n",
      "Though the movie suffers a little from franchise fatigue, this ain't half bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "This isn't as strong as the first two movies. (In fairness, the script is more cohesive than the first film). The individual character moments just don't have the impact and charm of the previous flicks. This probably has to do with the fact that there are just TOO many characters to juggle by now. I mean the overall story films is resolved competently, some elements and characters are just handled really quickly. If you missed Audrey, daughter of Cinderella, (played by the Charmed reboot's Sarah Jeffrey) in the second movie, you'll be pleased to see her back. But if you liked Lonnie, daughter of Mulan, (Dianne Doan) from the first two films, you'll be disappointed to see her missing. I'm guessing they just didn't have time for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Crammed plot aside, this is an okay film. (I mean by Disney Channel Movie standards. I'd still put this near the top of them.) Story and characters are decent. The cast is strong and everyone seems like they're having fun. (RIP Cameron Boyce). I'm legitimately impressed how this movie takes itself seriously in it's own way. There is legitimate character development and use of such issues as redemption and morality. The handling of the socioeconomics of the world of Auradon, where criminals have been banished to a prison island and their kids are forced to grow up on it, is surprisingly complex and nuanced for a Disney Channel movie. (Again, by the channel's standards. The bar must be set accordingly.) If this is to be the final film, it ends the story exactly where it needs to.\n",
      "\n",
      "The movie continues one of this series' biggest selling points: Its look. Again, we are bombarded by some delightully uber-corful and whimsical sets and costumes. I know the costumes are a little nuts, but they are just so distinctive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, the songs go downhill. They are mostly weak or just okay. They just aren't catchy. The best in this is probably the villain song Queen of Mean, but it runs completely on style, and I don't know how many people will remember this afterwards. The dancing, however, still remains pretty impressive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, if your kids liked Descendants 1 & 2, they'll probably likethis. In general, number 3, while not the standout of the films, is the ending the movies needed.\n",

      "reviewBody: As a fan of 'Descendants' from the beginning, I have watched all three movies the second they were released. Descendants has captivated my love and attention from the very first movie.Unfortunately, the third movie feels somewhat out of place in the series. It feels very different from the other movies, and it's not always in a good way. Audrey's story arc feels unrealistic and forced. Actress Sarah Jeffrey plays a convincing enough villain, but she became so evil so quickly that it feels forced. Her redemption arc at the end feels random and unnecessary. That being said, I did enjoy The Queen of Mean storyline.My other issue was Hades. The character was so anticipated and everyone expected him to be the next big villan. While his storyline was satisfying enough, I can't say that I wasn't disappointed. He was barely in the movie, and I found myself wanting more.It's also worth mentioning that most of the songs just weren't as good as the songs from 1 and 2.In conclusion, Descendants 3 was a good enough movie, and Disney Channel has one again given people something to enjoy. As much as I had fun watching, I can't see myself loving it as much as the first two.\n",

      "reviewBody: Ever since the first Descendants back in 2015, it started a lot of fans for this epic 3 movies saga. With the 3rd movie of The Descendants are both good & the bad. For starters, the casting. The actors of Descendants 3 have really done parts as their characters very well as well the returning actress: Sarah Jeffery really make the movie as good as Fairy Godmother in Cinderella. In fact, Audrey is both good and bad of being a tragic character. As she supposed to be the one who suppose to be the queen with Ben as her king not Mal. There's some good and corny moments towards Audrey being a new \"queen\" can be somewhat unnecessary seeing of the new character of Descendants 3: Hades. Saying of which, Cheyenne Jackson as Hades is somehow a really creative character. I wish Hades could have been the main villain of the movie, but he still perform a very good as the God of War himself even when he gets weird. Story itself is somewhat rather interesting that having three different arcs in one movie can be a total mess, but still pretty good in some parts like Mal & Uma finally becoming friends again, as well wiping up Mal's and Audrey's rivalry. And, the music this time around is really adds towards characters such as a necessary song number like Audrey: Queen of Mean to unnecessary song number like Evia: One Kiss. But, one flaw about the movie is that it could just expanded other characters that really deserved to be in the spotlight such as Hades, Squirmy, Squeaky, and Dizzy. Plus, there's some plot holes that the movie could have used such as explaining about Audrey plan & Hades Ember is powerful yet the Fairy Godmother wand is said to be powerful. There are some plot holes that leaving the viewers to notice from the previous movies. Besides the faults, Descendants 3 is a wonderful movie and a epic conclusion to a movie saga like this. While there's are some plot holes that didn't explain in the movie, but it's still holds up a good movie and giving a farewell the main 4 a concluding goodbye. Overall, I recommended watch this movie for those are fans of this 3 movies saga of 4 Descendants from Disney Villains. As well a farewell to the late death of Cameron Boyce. Farewell old friend.\n",

      "reviewBody: Love love loved D3!!! What a perfect ending for the trilogy!Mr Ortega made sure the messages of \"family,\" \"acceptance,\" \"second chances,\" and \"celebrating our differences\" came ringing through with fabulous music and dancing that was a lot of fun to watch -a lot of work for the actors too, I bet - but so worth it for the viewers.It was great to see Ben as the Beast finally. Audrey's turn to the bad side, especially after her Grammy berated her for letting the prince slip through her fingers, was a great way to show that bad can come from either side of the barrier. Then Hades part, although smaller than expected, brought the good in from the \"wrong side of the tracks\" - and his pride for his little girl was evident even though Mal had always felt he had abandoned her. I was so happy to see their relationship repair bit by bit as each of their scenes progressed. Dizzy and the Smee twins didn't play big parts but this story has always been about the core 4 anyway - exactly as I wanted to see - with a pop of the newbies here and there to let us know there was a program initiate to get more VKs to Auradon as Ben dreamed to make happen. Mal's unintentional selfishness to want to lock the barrier for good to keep the core 4s lives good and Auradon safe was a great way for Evie to teach about sharing the good life with all of the villain kids.All 3 movies in the Descendants franchise were absolutely fabulous! The last 4 years have been worth the wait and D3 topped it all off with a perfect ending. Watched D and D2 again before watching D3 4 times last night. Seriously enjoyed every bit of all 3 Descendants DCOMs and felt they flowed wonderfully!!! Previously reading the books between the movies added to that flow and were just as enjoyable. What a wonderful feel-good Disney story with strong messages about important aspects of life that children need to be taught so we can hopefully end hate someday. Our real life world could learn a lot from this trilogy and I can't wait to pass on my Descendants DVDs and soundtracks to my grandchildren one day so they can learn about acceptance in a fun and creative way.The dedication at the start and the tribute at the end for the extraordinary young man, Cameron Boyce, were real tear jerkers but I am so glad he is getting recognition he so deserves! Hope his legacy lives on forever because he lived his life sending out the same messages that the Disney Channel stands for - family, acceptance, caring, sharing, helping, and celebrating differences. His family have a right to be so proud of Cameron and I thank them for sharing him with us for all of these years (since 2011 for me).Regardless of what I say or others say - watch D3 yourself and make your own determination if you like it or not.\n",
